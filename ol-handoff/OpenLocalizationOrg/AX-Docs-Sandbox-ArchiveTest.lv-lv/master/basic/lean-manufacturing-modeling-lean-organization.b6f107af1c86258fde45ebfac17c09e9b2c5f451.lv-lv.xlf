          <source>To re-establish a production and cost context for the various kanban scenarios that are proposed in Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, Enterprise edition, activity-based production flows have been introduced as the backbone of lean manufacturing.</source>

          <source>Lean manufacturing for Dynamics AX integrates kanbans for inventoried products and semi-finished products in a single framework, and therefore offers a unified user experience for all cases.</source>

        <trans-unit id="122" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">

          <source>The reduction of batch sizes to the ideal state of a single piece flow in lean manufacturing can cause a dramatic increase in inventory transactions if each picking process or kanban registration causes transactions for the consumed items.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="126" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>The production flow architecture allows for the transfer of material to the production flow, together with the withdrawal kanbans in storage or transport handling unit sizes.</source>

        <trans-unit id="127" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>The value of the issued material is added to the work in progress (WIP) account that is related to the production flow.</source>

          <source>After the products are posted to inventory, the WIP account for the production flow is reduced by deducting by the related standard cost.</source>

        <trans-unit id="134" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>One approved method for implementing lean manufacturing solutions in the physical world of manufacturing is value stream mapping (VSM).</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="135" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>This method was introduced by Rother and Shook in their publication “Learning to See” at the Lean Manufacturing Institute.</source>

        <trans-unit id="138" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Movements or transfers can be modeled as transfer activities if the transfer status must be registered, or if integration with inventory picking or consolidated shipments is required.</source>

        <trans-unit id="139" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>The value stream itself is modeled as an operating unit in Dynamics AX.</source>

          <source>Therefore, the value stream can be used as a financial dimension.</source>

        <trans-unit id="145" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Therefore, an existing production flow version, together with all related kanban rules, can be copied to a future version of the production flow.</source>

          <source>A closer look at the activity concept reveals a new simplicity for those users who require it: the shop floor and logistics workers.</source>
