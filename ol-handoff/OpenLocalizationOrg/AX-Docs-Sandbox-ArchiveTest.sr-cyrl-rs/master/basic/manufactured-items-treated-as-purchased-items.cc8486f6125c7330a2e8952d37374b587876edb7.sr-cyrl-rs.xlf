          <source>Multi-sourcing is typically used for a purchased item that is occasionally manufactured, or when an item that was primarily a manufactured item is changed so that it's now primarily a purchased item.</source>

        <trans-unit id="108" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>The item is first designated as a manufactured item, so that bill of materials (BOM) and route information can be defined, and to support production orders for the item.</source>

          <source>In this case, the standard cost must be manually entered and activated for the item cost record.</source>
