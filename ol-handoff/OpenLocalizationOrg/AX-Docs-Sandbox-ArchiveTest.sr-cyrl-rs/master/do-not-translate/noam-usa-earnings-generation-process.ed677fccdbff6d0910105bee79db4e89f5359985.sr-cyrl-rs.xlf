          <source>Positions that are identified as salaried positions should receive a base earning amount, even if they have earnings that have been entered manually.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="131" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>For example, if you enter eight hours of sick time, the earnings statement lines are adjusted so that a worker receives no more and no less than the salary amount that is authorized for that worker's position.</source>

        <trans-unit id="132" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Recurring earnings and the earnings from schedules are created first, because salary amounts might be affected by other earnings that are automatically generated if those other earnings are considered base salary components.</source>

          <source><bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Note:<ept id="p1">**</ept> If you enter earning lines manually after you generate earnings, the earning lines that were previously generated are recalculated so that the worker pay is accurate.</source>

        <trans-unit id="137" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>To generate earnings for leave, you must assign a schedule to the position that the worker is taking leave from, even if that position is a salaried position.</source>
