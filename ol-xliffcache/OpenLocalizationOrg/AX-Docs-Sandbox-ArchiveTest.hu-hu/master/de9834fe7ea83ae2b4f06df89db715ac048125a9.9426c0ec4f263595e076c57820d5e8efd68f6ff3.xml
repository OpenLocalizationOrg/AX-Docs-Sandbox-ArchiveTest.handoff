This is the last procedure in the series that explains how to build combinations for dimension-based configuration. The execution of this procedure is dependent on the data created in the previous seven recordings. The demo data company used to create this procedure is USMF.\n\n\n## Find the dimension-based product master\n1. Click Released product maintenance.\n2. Click Released products.\n3. In the list, mark the selected row.\n    * Select the dimension-based product master that you created in the first recording in this sequence of 8 recordings.  \n\n## Create configurations\n1. On the Engineering Action Pane, click Maintain configurations.\n2. Click Configure.\n3. In the list, mark the selected row.\n4. In the Item number field, enter or select a value.\n    * Select any of the items in the first configuration group.  \n5. In the list, find and select the desired record.\n6. In the Item number field, enter or select a value.\n    * Select any item from the second configuration group.  \n7. Click OK.\n8. In the list, mark the selected row.\n9. In the Configuration field, type a value.\n    * Enter a configuration name that will make it easy to identify the configuration.  \n10. In the Description field, type a value.\n    * Enter a description of the configuration to explain what it contains.  \n11.
