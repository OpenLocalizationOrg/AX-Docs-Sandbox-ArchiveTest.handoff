The procedure \"Prepare a process kanban job when materials are available\" is a prerequisite for creating this procedure. This procedure is intended for the machine operator. The demo data company used to create this procedure is USMF.\n\n1. Go to Production control > Kanban > Kanban board for process jobs.\n2. In the Work cell field, click the drop-down button to open the lookup.\n3. In the list, click the link in the selected row.\n    * Select work cell 1250.  \n4. In the list, find and select the desired record.\n    * Select Kanban 000356.  \n5. In the list, find and select the desired record.\n    * In the list, deselect row 4. or Select row 4 if you haven't completed the task \"Prepare a process kanban job when materials are available.\"  \n6. Toggle the expansion of the Picking list section.\n    * The No entry icon in the supply status indicates that 48 ea of item P0002 are missing for the work cell.  \n\n## Transfer materials to work cell\n1. Toggle the expansion of the Transfer jobs section.\n2. Use the Quick Filter to filter on the Item number field with a value of 'P0002'.\n3. In the list, find and select the desired record.\n4. Click Start.\n    * Transfer is in progress.  \n5. Click Complete.\n    * Item P0002 is now available in the picking list for the kanban job. This means that we can prepare the kanban with all the needed materials.  \n6. Click Prepare.\n    * Notice that an icon in the Job status indicates that the job is now ready.  \n\n","nodes":[{"pos":[5,776],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"# required metadata \n \ntitle: Prepare a process kanban job when materials are not available for the work cell\ndescription: This procedure focuses on preparing a process kanban job when some materials are not available for the work cell, therefore it's necessary to pick materials from the warehouse. \nauthor: ChristianRytt\nmanager: AnnBe \nms.date: 11/11/2016\nms.topic: business-process \nms.prod:  \nms.service: dynamics-ax-applications \nms.technology:  \n \n# optional metadata \n \n# ms.search.form:   \naudience: Application User \n# ms.devlang:  \nms.reviewer: yuyus\nms.search.scope: Operations \n# ms.tgt_pltfrm:  \n# ms.custom:  \nms.search.region: Global\nms.search.industry: Manufacturing\nms.author: crytt\nms.search.validFrom: 2016-06-30 \nms.dyn365.ops.version: Version 7.0.0 ","nodes":[{"content":"Prepare a process kanban job when materials are not available for the work cell","nodes":[{"pos":[0,79],"content":"Prepare a process kanban job when materials are not available for the work cell","nodes":[{"content":"Prepare a process kanban job when materials are not available for the work cell","pos":[0,79]}]}],"path":["title"],"extradata":"MT"},{"content":"This procedure focuses on preparing a process kanban job when some materials are not available for the work cell, therefore it's necessary to pick materials from the warehouse.","nodes":[{"pos":[0,176],"content":"This procedure focuses on preparing a process kanban job when some materials are not available for the work cell, therefore it's necessary to pick materials from the warehouse.","nodes":[{"content":"This procedure focuses on preparing a process kanban job when some materials are not available for the work cell, therefore it's necessary to pick materials from the warehouse.","pos":[0,176]}]}],"path":["description"],"extradata":"MT"}],"header":"# required metadata \n","yml":true},{"pos":[783,862],"content":"Prepare a process kanban job when materials are not available for the work cell","linkify":"Prepare a process kanban job when materials are not available for the work cell","nodes":[{"content":"Prepare a process kanban job when materials are not available for the work cell","pos":[0,79]}]},{"content":"This procedure focuses on preparing a process kanban job when some materials are not available for the work cell, therefore it's necessary to pick materials from the warehouse.","pos":[932,1108]},{"content":"The procedure \"Prepare a process kanban job when materials are available\" is a prerequisite for creating this procedure.","pos":[1109,1229]},{"content":"This procedure is intended for the machine operator.","pos":[1230,1282]},{"content":"The demo data company used to create this procedure is USMF.","pos":[1283,1343]},{"content":"Go to Production control &gt; Kanban &gt; Kanban board for process jobs.","pos":[1348,1414],"source":"Go to Production control > Kanban > Kanban board for process jobs."},{"content":"In the Work cell field, click the drop-down button to open the lookup.","pos":[1418,1488]},{"content":"In the list, click the link in the selected row.","pos":[1492,1540]},{"content":"Select work cell 1250.","pos":[1547,1569]},{"content":"In the list, find and select the desired record.","pos":[1575,1623]},{"content":"Select Kanban 000356.","pos":[1630,1651]},{"content":"In the list, find and select the desired record.","pos":[1657,1705]},{"content":"In the list, deselect row 4.","pos":[1712,1740]},{"content":"or Select row 4 if you haven't completed the task \"Prepare a process kanban job when materials are available.\"","pos":[1741,1851]},{"content":"Toggle the expansion of the Picking list section.","pos":[1857,1906]},{"content":"The No entry icon in the supply status indicates that 48 ea of item P0002 are missing for the work cell.","pos":[1913,2017]},{"pos":[2024,2055],"content":"Transfer materials to work cell","linkify":"Transfer materials to work cell","nodes":[{"content":"Transfer materials to work cell","pos":[0,31]}]},{"content":"Toggle the expansion of the Transfer jobs section.","pos":[2059,2109]},{"content":"Use the Quick Filter to filter on the Item number field with a value of 'P0002'.","pos":[2113,2193]},{"content":"In the list, find and select the desired record.","pos":[2197,2245]},{"content":"Click Start.","pos":[2249,2261]},{"content":"Transfer is in progress.","pos":[2268,2292]},{"content":"Click Complete.","pos":[2298,2313]},{"content":"Item P0002 is now available in the picking list for the kanban job.","pos":[2320,2387]},{"content":"This means that we can prepare the kanban with all the needed materials.","pos":[2388,2460]},{"content":"Click Prepare.","pos":[2466,2480]},{"content":"Notice that an icon in the Job status indicates that the job is now ready.","pos":[2487,2561]}]}
