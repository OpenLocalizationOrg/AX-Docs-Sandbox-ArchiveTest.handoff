For cash and bank transactions, you can use either the daily exchange rate or an average exchange rate. For petty cash and bank journal lines, the calculation of the average exchange rate uses the summarized amounts of the accounting currency and the foreign currency before the specified transaction date.\n\nThis task was created using the demo data company DEMF with the country/region of legal entity primary address updated to be Hungary. This procedure is for a feature that was added in Dynamics 365 for Operations version 1611.\n\n1. Go to General ledger > Journal entries > General journals.\n2. Click New.\n3.
