You’ll be shown how to confirm a single order, and how to confirm multiple orders at once. These tasks would typically be carried out by a sales order processor. You can use this procedure in demo data company USMF or on your own data. Before you start, make sure there are several open sales orders for the same customer. If you’re using USMF, you can use customer US-027.\n\n\n## Confirm a single sales order\n1. Go to Sales and marketing > Sales orders > All sales orders.\n2. In the list, find and select the order that you want to confirm.\n3. Click the link on the sales order number to open the selected order.\n4. On the Action Pane, click Sell.\n5. Click Confirm sales order.\n6. Expand or collapse the Parameters section.\n    * Make sure that the Posting Yes field is active.  \n7. Set the Print confirmation option to Yes.\n    * The Check credit limit field specifies the method that’s used to calculate a customer's remaining credit. By default, it’s copied from the Accounts receivable parameters page. If you want to skip the credit limit check when confirming a specific sales order, set the Check credit limit to None. However, you should be aware that even with if this field is set to None, the credit limit check will still be performed if the Mandatory credit limit option is selected on the customer master data.  \n8. Click OK.\n9. Click Yes.\n10. Close the page.\n11. On the Action Pane, click Options.\n12. Click Change view.\n13. Click Header view.\n    * When an order is confirmed, the Document status is set to Confirmation.  \n14. On the Action Pane, click Sell.\n15. Click Sales order confirmation.\n16. Close the page.\n\n## Confirm multiple sales orders at once\n1. Go to Sales and marketing > Sales orders > Order confirmation > Confirm sales order.\n2. Click Select.\n3. In the list on the Range tab, find and select the record that references the Customer account field.\n4. In the Criteria field, click the drop-down button to open the lookup.\n5. In the list, find and select the customer account that has multiple orders which you want to mass confirm.\n    * If you’re using USMF, you can select account US-027.  \n6. Click OK.\n    * The Overview tab displays a list of the orders that match the query criteria. These will be included in the confirmation.  \n    * The Summary update for field specifies the parameter by which multiple orders are to be summarized into one confirmation document. By default, the option is copied from the Default values for summary update setting on the Accounts receivable parameters page.  \n7. In the Summary update for field, select 'Order'.\n    * The minimum parameters that are required to create summary updates are Invoice account and Currency. This means that summary updates that have different invoice accounts and different currencies are not allowed. Additional parameters can be set up in the Summary update parameters page which is accessible from the Accounts receivable parameters page.  \n8. In the Sales order field, click the drop-down button to open the lookup.\n9. In the list, select the order number that you want to be the summary order.\n10. Click Arrange.\n11. Click OK.\n12.
