Right-click the parallel branch, and then click **Properties**. The **Properties** form is displayed.\n2.  In the left pane, click **Basic Settings**.\n3.  In the **Name** field, enter a unique name for the parallel branch.\n4.  Click **Close**.\n\n## Design and configure the elements of a branch\nFollow these steps to design and configure the elements of a parallel branch.\n1.  Double-click the parallel branch.\n2.  Drag workflow elements onto the canvas, and then configure the elements, just as you would to create any other workflow.
