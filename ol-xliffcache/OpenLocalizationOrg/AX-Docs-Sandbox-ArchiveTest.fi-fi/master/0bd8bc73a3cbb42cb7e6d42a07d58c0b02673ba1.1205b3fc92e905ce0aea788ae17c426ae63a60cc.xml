The procedure will typically be carried out by a quality manager. The process includes the creation of a quality group, to define the items that are going to be sampled, and a test group to group the tests that are to be performed on items in the quality group. You can run this guide in the USMF demo data company.\n\n\n## Enable quality management\n1. Go to Inventory management > Setup > Inventory and warehouse management parameters.\n2. Click the Quality management tab.\n3. Set the Use quality management option to Yes.\n4. Click Report setup.\n    * In USMF, the report setup for quality management is already defined. If this wasn’t done, you’d add new lines here for the different report types, and select the type of document to be used for each report.  \n5. Close the page.\n6. Close the page.\n\n## Create a test\n1. Go to Inventory management > Setup > Quality control > Tests.\n2. Click New.\n3. In the Test field, type a value.\n4. In the Description field, type a value.\n5. In the Type field, select 'Option'.\n    * In this example, we'll select \"Option\" which will make it possible to assign the test results based on pre-defined values.  \n6. Click Save.\n7. Close the page.\n\n## Create Test variables to define the way test results are recorded\n1. Go to Inventory management > Setup > Quality control > Test variables.\n2. Click New.\n3. In the Variable field, type a value.\n4. In the Description field, type a value.\n5. Click Save.\n6. Click Outcomes.\n7. Click New.\n8. In the Outcome field, type a value.\n9. In the Description field, type a value.\n10. In the Outcome status field, select 'Pass'.\n11. Click Save.\n12. Click New.\n13. In the Outcome field, type a value.\n14. In the Description field, type a value.\n15. Click Save.\n16. Close the page.\n17. Close the page.\n\n## Set up item sampling\n1. Go to Inventory management > Setup > Quality control > Item sampling.\n2. Click New.\n3. In the Item sampling field, type a value.\n4. In the Description field, type a value.\n5. In the Value field, enter a number.\n    * This value relates to the Quantity specification that’s selected in the adjacent field.  \n6. Expand or collapse the Process section.\n7. Select or clear the Full blocking check box.\n    * If you select this option, the whole lot or order line quantity is blocked if a test is failed. If you don't select it, only the items in the quality order are blocked.  \n8. Click Save.\n9. Close the page.\n\n## Create a quality group\n1. Go to Inventory management > Setup > Quality control > Quality groups.\n2. Click New.\n3. In the Quality group field, type a value.\n    * Use a descriptive name to help you identify which kind of items the group will contain (your sampling criteria).  \n4. In the Description field, type a value.\n5. Click Save.\n6. Click Add items.\n7. Select the Item number row\n    * In this example the filtering will be run based on  the item number.  \n8. In the Criteria field, type a value.\n    * For example, type T* to filter on the item numbers that start with T.  \n9. Click OK.\n10. Click OK.\n11. Click Item quality groups.\n12. Close the page.\n13. Close the page.\n\n## Create a test group\n1. Go to Inventory management > Setup > Quality control > Test groups.\n2. Click New.\n3. In the Test group field, type a value.\n    * Give the Test group a name that will help you remember what kind of tests are being run, and which quality group it should be associated with. For example, it it’s to be used with a quality group that selects items starting with “T”, you could call it “T-item tests”.  \n4. In the Description field, type a value.\n5. In the Item sampling field, select the item sampling line that you created before.\n6. In the list, find and select the desired record.\n7. Click Add.\n8. In the Sequence number field, enter a number.\n9. In the Test field, select the test that you created earlier.\n10. In the list, find and select the desired record.\n11. Click the Test tab.\n12. In the Variable field, select the test variable that you created before\n13. In the list, find and select the desired record.\n14. In the Default outcome field, click the drop-down button to open the lookup.\n15. In the list, click the link in the selected row.\n16. Click Save.\n17. Close the page.\n\n## Define when quality orders will be created\n1. Go to Inventory management > Setup > Quality control > Quality associations.\n2. Click New.\n3. In the Reference type field, select an option.\n4. In the Item code field, select 'Group'.\n    * In this example, we’ll select \"Group\" and use the quality group we created before. You could also set this to \"Table\" to specify the items manually, or select \"All\" to add all items to the quality order.  \n5. In the Item field, select the quality group that you created before.\n    * The options available in the Item field depend on what you set in the Item code field.  \n6. In the list, find and select the desired record.\n7. Expand or collapse the Process section.\n8. In the Event type field, select an option.\n    * This is the event that triggers the test. The options available here depend on which process you selected in the Reference type field.  \n9. In the Execution field, select an option.\n10. Expand or collapse the Quality order process section.\n11. In the Event blocking field, click the drop-down button to open the lookup.\n    * This field shows the list of processes that it’s possible to block if the quality order is still open. The options depend on what you selected in the Event type field.  \n12. In the list, click the link in the selected row.\n    * This will be depending on the previous selected values. Select if the following processes must be blocked while having open quality orders linked to a source document line.  \n13. Expand or collapse the Specifications section.\n14. In the Test group field, select the test group that you created before.\n15. In the list, find and select the desired record.\n16. Click Save.\n17. Close the page.\n\n","nodes":[{"pos":[5,689],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"# required metadata \n \ntitle: Set up quality orders\ndescription: This procedure shows you how to enable a quality management process where incoming inventory must be inspected immediately after arrival registration. \nauthor: perlynne\nmanager: AnnBe \nms.date: 11/14/2016\nms.topic: business-process \nms.prod:  \nms.service: dynamics-ax-applications \nms.technology:  \n \n# optional metadata \n \n# ms.search.form:   \naudience: Application User \n# ms.devlang:  \nms.reviewer: bibis\nms.search.scope: Operations \n# ms.tgt_pltfrm:  \n# ms.custom:  \nms.search.region: Global\nms.search.industry: Distribution\nms.author: perlynne\nms.search.validFrom: 2016-06-30 \nms.dyn365.ops.version: Version 7.0.0 ","nodes":[{"content":"Set up quality orders","nodes":[{"pos":[0,21],"content":"Set up quality orders","nodes":[{"content":"Set up quality orders","pos":[0,21]}]}],"path":["title"],"extradata":"MT"},{"content":"This procedure shows you how to enable a quality management process where incoming inventory must be inspected immediately after arrival registration.","nodes":[{"pos":[0,150],"content":"This procedure shows you how to enable a quality management process where incoming inventory must be inspected immediately after arrival registration.","nodes":[{"content":"This procedure shows you how to enable a quality management process where incoming inventory must be inspected immediately after arrival registration.","pos":[0,150]}]}],"path":["description"],"extradata":"MT"}],"header":"# required metadata \n","yml":true},{"pos":[696,717],"content":"Set up quality orders","linkify":"Set up quality orders","nodes":[{"content":"Set up quality orders","pos":[0,21]}]},{"content":"This procedure shows you how to enable a quality management process where incoming inventory must be inspected immediately after arrival registration.","pos":[787,937]},{"content":"The procedure will typically be carried out by a quality manager.","pos":[938,1003]},{"content":"The process includes the creation of a quality group, to define the items that are going to be sampled, and a test group to group the tests that are to be performed on items in the quality group.","pos":[1004,1199]},{"content":"You can run this guide in the USMF demo data company.","pos":[1200,1253]},{"pos":[1259,1284],"content":"Enable quality management","linkify":"Enable quality management","nodes":[{"content":"Enable quality management","pos":[0,25]}]},{"content":"Go to Inventory management &gt;
