In this example, if the customer US-001 bought 1 unit of product T0004 today, they would be charged 350 CAD a unit. This price comes from an existing and active trade agreement with the customer.      Other fields on the page provide more details about the product price and product cost (if set up on the product master), and calculated profitability.  \n    * If the Show related product variants option is selected, it means that there are additional trade agreements for product's variants.  \n7.
