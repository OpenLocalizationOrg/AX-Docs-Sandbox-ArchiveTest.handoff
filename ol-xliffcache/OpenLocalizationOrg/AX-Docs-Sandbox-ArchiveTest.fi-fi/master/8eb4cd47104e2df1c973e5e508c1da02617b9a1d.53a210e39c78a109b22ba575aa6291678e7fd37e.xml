It shows you different ways to search for products in your procurement catalogue and how to add a product that isn’t in your catalogue. Before you start this procedure, you must have a purchasing policy set up with Consumption as the default type of requisition. You can walk through this procedure in demo data company USMF, or using your own data. The procedure can only be carried out by a user profile that is set up as worker.  This task would normally be carried out by an employee. The Employee employ security role will allow you to carry out the tasks, or if you’re using USMF, you can log in as Alicia.\n\n\n## Create a new requisition\n1.

If you already know the product number or you already  know that you are requesting a product that is not in the product catalogueue, then you can add the line directly with \"Add line\". The other way is to use \"Add products\" where you can use searching and filtering to find items in the product catalogueue.    \n2. Click on the row you just created.\n    * The requester is the worker that has requested the requisition.   \n    * By default the person preparing the requisition is the worker who has requested it. You have to be given permission to prepare a requisition line on behalf of another worker. If you have such permissions then the other workers will show up in this lookup.  \n3. In the Item number field, type a value.\n    * The items that are available for you to choose are limited by the category access policy and the procurement catalogue for the buying legal entity.   \n4.

In the Unit price field, enter a number.\n    * If you know the price for a particular vendor (that you select in the vendor account field) then that price can be entered   \n17. In the Vendor account field, click the drop-down button to open the lookup.\n    * The vendors that are available in this field depend on the purchasing policies and the status that the vendor has for the current procurement category. As an alternative to selecting a vendor here, you can click the Suggest vendor button.    \n18. In the list, select the vendor you want to use.\n19. In the External item number field, type a value.\n    * This is a reference number for the product that is known by the vendor.
