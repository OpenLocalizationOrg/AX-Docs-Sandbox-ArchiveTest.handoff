The warehouse may be known, but it is not used in the master planning calculation.\n-   The site dimension is set for coverage planning.\n-   The warehouse dimension is not set for coverage planning. Therefore, supply and demand are aggregated by site and, perhaps, other coverage-planned dimensions also.\n\nThe following graphic illustrates how master planning proceeds. The parameters that are referred to in the graphic, and their locations, are as follows:\n-   Item coverage is defined for the item. Click **Product information management &gt; Products&gt; Released products**. Select the item, and then click **Plan &gt; Item coverage**.\n-   Refill relations are defined for the warehouse. Click **Inventory management &gt; Setup &gt; Inventory breakdown &gt; Warehouses**. On the **Master planning** tab, see the **Main warehouse** field group.\n-   The default order type is set to Production, Purchase order or Kanban. Click **Product information management &gt; Products&gt; Released products**. Select the item, and then click **Plan &gt; Default order settings**. In the **Default order settings** form, see the **Default order type** field.\n\n![Demand for site coverage warehouse not mandatory](./media/multisitedemandexplosionscenarioforsitecoveragewarehousenotmandatory.jpg)\n\n\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n[Master planning and multisite functionality](master-plan-multisite-functionality.md)\n\n[Master planning - site coverage, warehouse mandatory](master-plan-site-coverage-warehouse-mandatory.md)\n\n[Master planning - site and warehouse coverage, warehouse not mandatory](master-plan-site-warehouse-coverage-warehouse-not-mandatory.md)\n\n[Master planning - site and warehouse coverage, warehouse mandatory](master-plan-site-warehouse-coverage-warehouse-mandatory.md)\n\n[Master planning - how the BOM version is determined](master-plan-bom-version-determined.md)\n\n\n\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,771],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"# required metadata\n\ntitle: Master planning for site coverage, warehouse not mandatory\ndescription: This topic describes how an item that has the site dimension set for coverage is planned.\nauthor: YuyuScheller\nmanager: AnnBe\nms.date: 06/20/2017\nms.topic: article\nms.prod: \nms.service: dynamics-ax-applications\nms.technology: \n\n# optional metadata\n\nms.search.form: EcoResStorageDimensionGroup, ReqItemTable\n# ROBOTS: \naudience: Application User\n# ms.devlang: \nms.reviewer: yuyus\nms.search.scope: Core, AX 7.0.0, Operations, UnifiedOperations\n# ms.tgt_pltfrm: \nms.custom: 2474\nms.assetid: 316da918-67ae-43c5-baea-00ae559e29b0\nms.search.region: Global\nms.search.industry: Manufacturing\nms.author: roxanad\nms.search.validFrom: 2016-02-28\nms.dyn365.ops.version: AX 7.0.0\n","nodes":[{"content":"Master planning for site coverage, warehouse not mandatory","nodes":[{"pos":[0,58],"content":"Master planning for site coverage, warehouse not mandatory","nodes":[{"content":"Master planning for site coverage, warehouse not mandatory","pos":[0,58]}]}],"path":["title"],"extradata":"MT"},{"content":"This topic describes how an item that has the site dimension set for coverage is planned.","nodes":[{"pos":[0,89],"content":"This topic describes how an item that has the site dimension set for coverage is planned.","nodes":[{"content":"This topic describes how an item that has the site dimension set for coverage is planned.","pos":[0,89]}]}],"path":["description"],"extradata":"MT"}],"header":"# required metadata\n","yml":true},{"pos":[779,837],"content":"Master planning for site coverage, warehouse not mandatory","linkify":"Master planning for site coverage, warehouse not mandatory","nodes":[{"content":"Master planning for site coverage, warehouse not mandatory","pos":[0,58]}]},{"content":"This topic describes how an item that has the site dimension set for coverage is planned.","pos":[883,972]},{"content":"This master planning scenario involves the following conditions:","pos":[974,1038]},{"content":"The site dimension is set to mandatory and must be entered on the demand transaction.","pos":[1044,1129]},{"content":"The warehouse dimension is not set to mandatory.","pos":[1134,1182]},{"content":"The warehouse may be known, but it is not used in the master planning calculation.","pos":[1183,1265]},{"content":"The site dimension is set for coverage planning.","pos":[1270,1318]},{"content":"The warehouse dimension is not set for coverage planning.","pos":[1323,1380]},{"content":"Therefore, supply and demand are aggregated by site and, perhaps, other coverage-planned dimensions also.","pos":[1381,1486]},{"content":"The following graphic illustrates how master planning proceeds.","pos":[1488,1551]},{"content":"The parameters that are referred to in the graphic, and their locations, are as follows:","pos":[1552,1640]},{"content":"Item coverage is defined for the item.","pos":[1645,1683]},{"content":"Click <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Product information management <ph id=\"ph1\">&amp;gt;</ph> Products<ph id=\"ph2\">&amp;gt;</ph> Released products<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept>.","pos":[1684,1761],"source":" Click **Product information management &gt;
