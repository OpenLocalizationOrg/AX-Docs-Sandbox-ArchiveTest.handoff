This procedure explains how system administrators can assign users to roles automatically, based on business data. The demo data company used to create this procedure is USMF.\n\n\n## Automatically assign users to roles\n1. Go to System administration > Security > Assign users to roles.\n2. In the tree, select 'Accounting supervisor'.\n    * Select the role that you want to configure the rule for. In this example, select Accounting supervisor.  \n3. Click Add rule to open the drop dialog.\n4. In the list, find and select the desired record.\n    * Select the query to use for this rule.  \n5. In the list, click the link in the selected row.\n6. Click Edit query.\n    * Edit the query, as needed.  \n7. Click OK.\n\n## Exclude users from automatic role assignment\n1. Close the page.\n2. Go to System administration > Security > Assign users to roles.\n3. In the tree, select 'Accounting supervisor'.\n    * Select a role. For this example, select Accounting supervisor.  \n4. Click Manually assign / exclude users.\n5. In the list, mark the selected row.\n    * Select a user.  \n6. Click Exclude from role.\n    * Click Exclude from role to exclude the selected users from the role. To remove exclusions, select the users that you want to remove exclusions for, and then click Reset status. When you remove an exclusion by resetting the user’s status, the user’s role is again assigned automatically. However, the user is not immediately assigned to the role or excluded from the role when you reset the status. Instead, the user is either assigned to the role or removed from the role the next time that the rules for automatic role assignment are run.  \n\n","nodes":[{"pos":[5,662],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"# required metadata \n \ntitle: Assign users to security roles\ndescription: To access Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, Enterprise edition, users must be assigned to security roles. \nauthor: maertenm\nmanager: AnnBe \nms.date: 06/07/2016\nms.topic: business-process \nms.prod:  \nms.service: dynamics-ax-applications \nms.technology:  \n \n# optional metadata \n \n# ms.search.form:   \naudience: Application User \n# ms.devlang:  \nms.reviewer: sericks\nms.search.scope: Operations \n# ms.tgt_pltfrm:  \n# ms.custom:  \nms.search.region: Global\n# ms.search.industry: \nms.author: maertenm\nms.search.validFrom: 2016-06-30 \nms.dyn365.ops.version: Version 7.0.0 ","nodes":[{"content":"Assign users to security roles","nodes":[{"pos":[0,30],"content":"Assign users to security roles","nodes":[{"content":"Assign users to security roles","pos":[0,30]}]}],"path":["title"],"extradata":"MT"},{"content":"To access Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, Enterprise edition, users must be assigned to security roles.","nodes":[{"pos":[0,122],"content":"To access Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, Enterprise edition, users must be assigned to security roles.","nodes":[{"content":"To access Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, Enterprise edition, users must be assigned to security roles.","pos":[0,122]}]}],"path":["description"],"extradata":"MT"}],"header":"# required metadata \n","yml":true},{"pos":[669,699],"content":"Assign users to security roles","linkify":"Assign users to security roles","nodes":[{"content":"Assign users to security roles","pos":[0,30]}]},{"content":"To access Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, Enterprise edition, users must be assigned to security roles.","pos":[769,891]},{"content":"This procedure explains how system administrators can assign users to roles automatically, based on business data.","pos":[892,1006]},{"content":"The demo data company used to create this procedure is USMF.","pos":[1007,1067]},{"pos":[1073,1108],"content":"Automatically assign users to roles","linkify":"Automatically assign users to roles","nodes":[{"content":"Automatically assign users to roles","pos":[0,35]}]},{"content":"Go to System administration &gt; Security &gt; Assign users to roles.","pos":[1112,1175],"source":"Go to System administration > Security > Assign users to roles."},{"content":"In the tree, select 'Accounting supervisor'.","pos":[1179,1223]},{"content":"Select the role that you want to configure the rule for.","pos":[1230,1286]},{"content":"In this example, select Accounting supervisor.","pos":[1287,1333]},{"content":"Click Add rule to open the drop dialog.","pos":[1339,1378]},{"content":"In the list, find and select the desired record.","pos":[1382,1430]},{"content":"Select the query to use for this rule.","pos":[1437,1475]},{"content":"In the list, click the link in the selected row.","pos":[1481,1529]},{"content":"Click Edit query.","pos":[1533,1550]},{"content":"Edit the query, as needed.","pos":[1557,1583]},{"content":"Click OK.","pos":[1589,1598]},{"pos":[1603,1647],"content":"Exclude users from automatic role assignment","linkify":"Exclude users from automatic role assignment","nodes":[{"content":"Exclude users from automatic role assignment","pos":[0,44]}]},{"content":"Close the page.","pos":[1651,1666]},{"content":"Go to System administration &gt; Security &gt; Assign users to roles.","pos":[1670,1733],"source":"Go to System administration > Security > Assign users to roles."},{"content":"In the tree, select 'Accounting supervisor'.","pos":[1737,1781]},{"content":"Select a role.","pos":[1788,1802]},{"content":"For this example, select Accounting supervisor.","pos":[1803,1850]},{"content":"Click Manually assign / exclude users.","pos":[1856,1894]},{"content":"In the list, mark the selected row.","pos":[1898,1933]},{"content":"Select a user.","pos":[1940,1954]},{"content":"Click Exclude from role.","pos":[1960,1984]},{"content":"Click Exclude from role to exclude the selected users from the role.","pos":[1991,2059]},{"content":"To remove exclusions, select the users that you want to remove exclusions for, and then click Reset status.","pos":[2060,2167]},{"content":"When you remove an exclusion by resetting the user’s status, the user’s role is again assigned automatically.","pos":[2168,2277]},{"content":"However, the user is not immediately assigned to the role or excluded from the role when you reset the status.","pos":[2278,2388]},{"content":"Instead, the user is either assigned to the role or removed from the role the next time that the rules for automatic role assignment are run.","pos":[2389,2530]}]}
