This procedure explains how a custom version of a format can be created based on the format received from a configuration provider (CP). It also explains how to adopt a new, base version of that format.\n\n\n\nTo complete these steps, you must first complete the steps in the “Create a configuration provider and mark it as active” and “Use created format to generate electronic documents for payments” procedures. These steps can be performed in the GBSI company.\n\n\n## Select format configuration for customization\n1. Go to Organization administration > Workspaces > Electronic reporting.\n    * In this example, sample company Litware, Inc. (http://www.litware.com) will act as a configuration provider that supports format configurations for electronic payments for a particular country.    Sample company Proseware, Inc. (http://www.proseware.com) will act as a consumer of the format configuration that Litware, Inc. provided. Proseware, Inc. uses formats in certain regions of that country.  \n2. Click Reporting configurations.\n3. Click Show filters.\n4. Apply the following filters: Enter a filter value of \"BACS (UK fictitious)\" on the \"Name\" field using the \"begins with\" filter operator\n    * BACS (UK fictitious)  \n    * The selected format configuration BACS (UK fictitious) is owned by provider Litware, Inc.  \n5. Click Show filters.\n6. In the list, find and select the desired record.\n    * The version of the format with the status of Completed will be used by Proseware, Inc. for customization.  \n\n## Create a new configuration for your custom format of electronic document\n    * Proseware, Inc. received version 1.1 of BACS (UK fictitious) configuration that contains the initial format to generate electronic payment documents from Litware, Inc. in accordance to their service subscription. Proseware, Inc. wants to start using this as a standard for their country but some customization is required to support specific regional requirements. Proseware, Inc. also wants to keep the ability to upgrade a custom format as soon as a new version of it (with changes to support new country-specific requirements) comes from Litware, Inc. and they want to perform this upgrade with the lowest cost.  To do this, Proseware, Inc. needs to create a configuration using the Litware, Inc. configuration BACS (UK fictitious) as a base.  \n1. Close the page.\n2.

Click OK.\n    * Note that some conflicts have been discovered between merging the custom version and a new base version representing some format changes that can’t be merged automatically.  \n\n## Resolve rebase conflicts\n1. Click Designer.\n    * Note that changes to the vendor’s name text length limit couldn’t be resolved automatically. Therefore, this is presented in a conflicts list. For each conflict of type Update, the following options are available:  - Apply a prior base value (button on top of the grid) to bring in the previous base version value (0 in our case).  - Apply a base value (button on top of the grid) to bring in the new base version value (100 in our case).  - Keep your own (custom) value (60 in our case).  Click Apply base value to apply a country-specific limit of 100 characters for vendor’s name text length.  \n    * Note that Proseware, Inc. and Litware, Inc. have custom and local versions of this format using IBAN and SWIFT codes with related components that are automatically merged in the managing format.  \n2. Click Apply base value.\n    * Click Apply base value to apply the country-specific limit of 100 characters for vendor names.  \n3. Click Save.\n    * Saving the format will remove resolved conflicts from the conflicts list.  \n4. Close the page.\n\n## Change the status of the new version of the custom format configuration\n1. Click Change status.\n    * Change the status of the updated, custom format configuration from Draft to Completed. This will make the format configuration available for generating payment documents. Note that the current version of the selected configuration is in Draft status.  \n2. Click Complete.\n3. In the Description field, type a value.\n4. Click OK.\n    * Note that the created configuration is saved as completed version 1.2.2: version 2 of base BACS (UK fictitious custom) format, which is based on version 2 of base BACS (UK fictitious) format, which is based on version 1 of Payments (simplified model) data model.  \n\n## Test the customized format for payment files generation\n    * Complete the steps in the “Use created format to generate electronic documents for payments” procedure in parallel Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, Enterprise edition session. Select the created ‘BACS (UK fictitious custom)’ format in electronic payment method parameters. Make sure that the created payment file contains recently introduced by Proseware, Inc. XML node presenting IBAN account code in accordance to regional requirements. The file also should contain the recently introduced by Litware, Inc. XML node presenting SWIFT bank code in accordance to country requirements.  \n\n","nodes":[{"pos":[5,772],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"# required metadata \n \ntitle: Upgrade your format by adopting of new base version of that format for electronic reporting (ER)\ndescription: The following steps explain how a user in the System Administrator or Electronic Reporting Developer role can maintain an Electronic reporting (ER) format configuration. \nauthor: NickSelin\nmanager: AnnBe \nms.date: 02/06/2017\nms.topic: business-process \nms.prod:  \nms.service: dynamics-ax-applications \nms.technology:  \n \n# optional metadata \n \n# ms.search.form:   \naudience: Application User \n# ms.devlang:  \nms.reviewer: kfend\nms.search.scope: Operations \n# ms.tgt_pltfrm:  \n# ms.custom:  \nms.search.region: Global\n# ms.search.industry: \nms.author: nselin\nms.search.validFrom: 2016-06-30 \nms.dyn365.ops.version: Version 7.0.0 ","nodes":[{"content":"Upgrade your format by adopting of new base version of that format for electronic reporting (ER)","nodes":[{"pos":[0,96],"content":"Upgrade your format by adopting of new base version of that format for electronic reporting (ER)","nodes":[{"content":"Upgrade your format by adopting of new base version of that format for electronic reporting (ER)","pos":[0,96]}]}],"path":["title"],"extradata":"MT"},{"content":"The following steps explain how a user in the System Administrator or Electronic Reporting Developer role can maintain an Electronic reporting (ER) format configuration.","nodes":[{"pos":[0,169],"content":"The following steps explain how a user in the System Administrator or Electronic Reporting Developer role can maintain an Electronic reporting (ER) format configuration.","nodes":[{"content":"The following steps explain how a user in the System Administrator or Electronic Reporting Developer role can maintain an Electronic reporting (ER) format configuration.","pos":[0,169]}]}],"path":["description"],"extradata":"MT"}],"header":"# required metadata \n","yml":true},{"pos":[779,875],"content":"Upgrade your format by adopting of new base version of that format for electronic reporting (ER)","linkify":"Upgrade your format by adopting of new base version of that format for electronic reporting (ER)","nodes":[{"content":"Upgrade your format by adopting of new base version of that format for electronic reporting (ER)","pos":[0,96]}]},{"content":"The following steps explain how a user in the System Administrator or Electronic Reporting Developer role can maintain an Electronic reporting (ER) format configuration.","pos":[945,1114]},{"content":"This procedure explains how a custom version of a format can be created based on the format received from a configuration provider (CP).","pos":[1115,1251]},{"content":"It also explains how to adopt a new, base version of that format.","pos":[1252,1317]},{"content":"To complete these steps, you must first complete the steps in the “Create a configuration provider and mark it as active” and “Use created format to generate electronic documents for payments” procedures.","pos":[1321,1525]},{"content":"These steps can be performed in the GBSI company.","pos":[1526,1575]},{"pos":[1581,1626],"content":"Select format configuration for customization","linkify":"Select format configuration for customization","nodes":[{"content":"Select format configuration for customization","pos":[0,45]}]},{"content":"Go to Organization administration &gt; Workspaces &gt; Electronic reporting.","pos":[1630,1700],"source":"Go to Organization administration > Workspaces > Electronic reporting."},{"content":"In this example, sample company Litware, Inc.
