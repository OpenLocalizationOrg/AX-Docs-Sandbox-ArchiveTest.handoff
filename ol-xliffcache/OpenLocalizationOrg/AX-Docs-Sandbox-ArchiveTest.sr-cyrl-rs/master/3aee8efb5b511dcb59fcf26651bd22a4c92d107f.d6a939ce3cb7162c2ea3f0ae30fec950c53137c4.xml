This checklist doesn't include any guidelines that will be enforced automatically through the development environment. Open the form in the browser, and walk through these steps.\n\n-   The filter field should have a drop-down that contains the list of available values.\n-   The expectation is that the filter field will be modified multiple times per day by the target user. If the filter field is modified less often or is primarily static, it should be put in a configuration dialog.\n-   If more filter fields are needed, they should be put in a configuration dialog (up to five filter fields).\n\n## Examples\nForm: **ReqCreatePlanWorkspace** (**All workspaces** &gt; **Master Planning**) \n\n[![workspacePageFilterGroupExample](./media/workspacepagefiltergroupexample.png)](./media/workspacepagefiltergroupexample.png)\n\n## Appendix\n### Frequently asked questions\n\nThis section will have answers to frequently asked questions that are related to this guideline/pattern.\n\n### Open issues\n\nNone\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,818],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"# required metadata\n\ntitle: Workspace Page Filter Group subpattern\ndescription: This article provides information about the Workspace Page Filter Group subpattern.
