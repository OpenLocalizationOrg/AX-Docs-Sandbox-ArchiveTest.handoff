By defining relations, you enable validation of the data that is entered and lookup capabilities for the related information. \n\nYou can add a new relation by extending a table.\n\nIn the following example, a new field, **MyInventLocationId**, is added to the InventTable table. This field is a reference to the InventLocation table that contains warehouses.\n\n1. In the new extension model, create an extension of the InventTable table.\n1. Create a new relation, just as you would create a relation on a regular table.\n1. Specify the **Related Table**, **Relationship Type**, and **Cardinality** properties, and any other properties that apply to the relation.\n1. Add the link by specifying the fields from the InventTable table and the InventLocation table that have the same value. In this case, the fields are **MyInventLocationId** in the InventTable table and **InventLocationId** in the InventLocation table.\n\nThe following illustration shows the new relation.\n\n![New relation](media/AddRelationToExistingTable.jpg)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,596],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"\n# required metadata\n\ntitle: Add a relation to a table\ndescription: This topic explains how to add a relation to a table.\nauthor: ivanv-microsoft\nmanager: AnnBe\nms.date: 07/10/2017\nms.topic: article\nms.prod: \nms.service: dynamics-ax-platform\nms.technology: \n\n\n# optional metadata\n\n# ms.search.form: \n# ROBOTS: \naudience: Developer\n# ms.devlang: \nms.reviewer: robinr\nms.search.scope: Operations, Platform\n# ms.tgt_pltfrm: \nms.custom: 268724\nms.assetid: \nms.search.region: Global\n# ms.search.industry: \nms.author: ivanv\nms.search.validFrom: 2017-07-01\nms.dyn365.ops.version: Platform update 4\n\n","nodes":[{"content":"Add a relation to a table","nodes":[{"pos":[0,25],"content":"Add a relation to a table","nodes":[{"content":"Add a relation to a table","pos":[0,25]}]}],"path":["title"],"extradata":"MT"},{"content":"This topic explains how to add a relation to a table.","nodes":[{"pos":[0,53],"content":"This topic explains how to add a relation to a table.","nodes":[{"content":"This topic explains how to add a relation to a table.","pos":[0,53]}]}],"path":["description"],"extradata":"MT"}],"yml":true},{"pos":[604,629],"content":"Add a relation to a table","linkify":"Add a relation to a table","nodes":[{"content":"Add a relation to a table","pos":[0,25]}]},{"content":"To enable rich and secure interactions with data in multiple tables, you must help guarantee referential integrity by defining relations that describe the link between two tables.","pos":[631,810]},{"content":"By defining relations, you enable validation of the data that is entered and lookup capabilities for the related information.","pos":[811,936]},{"content":"You can add a new relation by extending a table.","pos":[939,987]},{"content":"In the following example, a new field, <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>MyInventLocationId<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept>, is added to the InventTable table.","pos":[989,1086],"source":"In the following example, a new field, **MyInventLocationId**, is added to the InventTable table."},{"content":"This field is a reference to the InventLocation table that contains warehouses.","pos":[1087,1166]},{"content":"In the new extension model, create an extension of the InventTable table.","pos":[1171,1244]},{"content":"Create a new relation, just as you would create a relation on a regular table.","pos":[1248,1326]},{"pos":[1330,1468],"content":"Specify the <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Related Table<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept>, <bpt id=\"p2\">**</bpt>Relationship Type<ept id=\"p2\">**</ept>, and <bpt id=\"p3\">**</bpt>Cardinality<ept id=\"p3\">**</ept> properties, and any other properties that apply to the relation.","source":"Specify the **Related Table**, **Relationship Type**, and **Cardinality** properties, and any other properties that apply to the relation."},{"content":"Add the link by specifying the fields from the InventTable table and the InventLocation table that have the same value.","pos":[1472,1591]},{"content":"In this case, the fields are <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>MyInventLocationId<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> in the InventTable table and <bpt id=\"p2\">**</bpt>InventLocationId<ept id=\"p2\">**</ept> in the InventLocation table.","pos":[1592,1722],"source":" In this case, the fields are **MyInventLocationId** in the InventTable table and **InventLocationId** in the InventLocation table."},{"content":"The following illustration shows the new relation.","pos":[1724,1774]},{"content":"New relation","pos":[1778,1790]}]}
