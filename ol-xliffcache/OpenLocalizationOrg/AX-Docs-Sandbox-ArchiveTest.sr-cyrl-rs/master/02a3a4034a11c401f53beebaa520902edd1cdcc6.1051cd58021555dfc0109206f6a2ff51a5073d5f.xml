This pattern is primarily used in conjunction with the Operational Workspace pattern, and specifically on forms that contain a chart control.\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nThe Section Chart form pattern is intended to be used primarily in conjunction with the Operational Workspace pattern. Specifically, the chart section or summary section contains Form Part Controls that point to forms that contain charts. These referenced forms are intended to use the Section Chart pattern.\n\n## Wireframe\n[![sectionChartWireframe](./media/sectionchartwireframe1.png)](./media/sectionchartwireframe1.png)\n\n## Pattern changes for Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, Enterprise edition\nThis pattern didn't exist for Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012.\n\n## Model\n### High-level structure\n\n- Form Design\n\n    - *HeaderGroup (Group) \\[Optional\\]* – This uses one of the [Filters and Toolbar](filters-toolbar-subpattern.md) subpatterns.\n    - Chart\n\n### Core components\n\nApply the Section Chart pattern to the appropriate form/container.\n\n### Related container patterns\n\n-   [Operational workspace](workspace-form-pattern.md)\n-   [Section stacked chart](section-stacked-chart-subpattern.md)\n\n## UX guidelines\nThe verification checklist shows the steps for manually verifying that the form complies with UX guidelines.
