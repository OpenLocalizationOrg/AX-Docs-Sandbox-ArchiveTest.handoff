For every posted sales transaction or purchase transaction where the **Date of VAT register** or **VAT report date code** field is set, the tax will be accounted in relevant VAT registers. The **VAT report date code** field appears on several transaction pages. When you update or post transactions, information about the VAT report date code is posted to the tax tables. It will then be printed on the Polish VAT register. To set up VAT report date codes, open the **VAT report date codes** page (**Tax** &gt; **Setup** &gt; **Sales tax** &gt; **VAT report date codes**), and set the following fields.\n\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"header\">\n<th>Field</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td>VAT report date code</td>\n<td>Enter the VAT report date code.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td>Description</td>\n<td>Enter a description of the VAT report date code.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td>Include in VAT report</td>\n<td>Select one of the following options:\n<ul>\n<li><strong>With VAT report date</strong> - The report shows the whole invoice amount if the calculated date in the <strong>Date of VAT register</strong> field on the <strong>Invoice posting</strong> page is in the date interval for the report.</li>\n<li><strong>With VAT report date not later than</strong>  The report shows the whole invoice amount if the date in the <strong>Date of VAT register</strong> field is in the date interval for the report.

You set up service tariff numbers on the **Service tariff numbers** page. To set up service tariff numbers, click **Tax** &gt; **Setup** &gt; **Sales tax** &gt; **Service tariff number**, and set the following fields.\n\n| Field                      | Description                                                                          |\n|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Service tariff number      | Enter the service tariff number that the government authority assigned to the party. |\n| Service tariff description | Enter a description of the service tariff number.                                    |\n\nYou can also set a parameter to make the service tariff number mandatory. Click **Tax** &gt; **Sales tax** &gt; **Sales tax group**, and then, on the **General** FastTab, set the **Mandatory service tariff number** field. The **Mandatory service tariff number** parameter affects the following pages:\n\n-   **All sales orders** (click **Accounts receivable** &gt; **Orders** &gt; **All sales orders**) (Header and lines)\n-   **All free text invoices** (click **Accounts receivable** &gt; **Invoices**&gt; **All free text invoices**) (Header and lines)\n-   **Voided sales orders** (click **Sales and marketing** &gt; **Inquiries and reports** &gt; **History** &gt; **Voided sales orders**, and then click **Show**)\n\nThe following shared functionality works on all the preceding pages:\n\n-   When you create a new line, the service tariff number is copied from the header to the line.\n-   If the **Mandatory service tariff number** parameter is enabled on the sales tax group, the invoice is stopped, and you receive an error message.\n-   When you post an invoice, sales tax transactions are split by service tariff number. Even the sales tax group and item sales tax group are the same.\n-   When you create a credit note for any posted invoice where the lines have a value in the **Service tariff number** field, the service tariff number is copied to credit note lines from the original document, not from the credit note header. The service tariff number can be edited on for the correction line.\n\n## Poland - Base amount for VAT\nThe **Base amount for VAT** field is enabled when you enter a tax transaction (the **Tax code** field has a value on journal lines) in the following journals:\n\n-   Invoice journal (click **Accounts payable** &gt; **Journals** &gt; **Invoices** &gt; **Invoice journal**, click **Lines**, and then click the **General** tab)\n-   General journal (click **General ledger** &gt; **Journals** &gt; **General journal**, click **Lines**, and then click the **General** tab)\n-   Slip journal (click **Cash and bank management** &gt; **Cash transactions** &gt; **Slip journal**, click **Lines**, and then click the **General** tab)\n\nIn the **Base amount for VAT** field, you manually enter the tax base amount. After you post a journal, the value from the **Base amount for VAT** field transferred to **the Amount origin** field in tax transactions.\n\n## Poland - Sales tax (VAT) reporting\nThis feature is used in ledger journals where multiple lines have the same voucher. When the following fields on one line are changed, a message box appears that lets you update the fields on other lines that have the same voucher:\n\n-   Invoice\n-   Document date\n-   Address\n-   Tax exempt number\n-   Customer/ Vendor\n-   Date of VAT register\n-   VAT report date code\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> The message box appears only when the fields were changed for a line where a sales tax group, item sales tax group, and sales tax code are set up. The message is triggered on the following journal pages:\n\n-   General journal (click **General ledger** &gt; **Journals** &gt; **General journal**, and then click **Lines**)\n-   Invoice journal (click **Accounts payable** &gt; **Journals** &gt; **Invoices** &gt; **Invoice journal**, and then click **Lines**)\n\n## Poland - Tax direction for the line\nThe feature is related to postings through the general journal that involves sales tax transactions. The system automatically determines the sales tax direction that should be assigned to tax transactions that are created, based on the account type that was used for the posting. This feature enables main accounts to be determined correctly and the sales tax direction to be assigned correctly for general journal lines within the same voucher. Lines must meet one of the following conditions:\n\n-   The account type is **Customer**, **Vendor**, or **Petty cash**, and the offset account type is **Ledger**. The offset account must be specified.\n-   The account type is **Ledger**, and the offset account type is **Customer**, **Vendor**, or **Petty cash**. The offset account must be specified.\n\nFor general journal lines that meet the preceding conditions, the system assigns a separate sales tax direction, as follows:\n\n-   **Sales tax payable** for the **Customer** account type\n-   **Sales tax receivable** for the **Vendor** account type\n-   **Sales tax payable** for the **Petty cash** account type\n\n### Example\n\nYou create the following general journal lines.\n\n| Account type | Account number | Debit | Credit | Offset account type | Offset account number | Sales tax posting group | Item sales tax posting group |\n|--------------|----------------|-------|--------|---------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------|------------------------------|\n| Customer     | 1101           |       | 800    | Ledger              | 0101                  | AR-DOM                  | FULL                         |\n| Vendor       | 1001           |       | 800    | Ledger              | 0101                  | AR-DOM                  | FULL                         |\n| Ledger       | 0102           | 700   |        |                     |                       | AR-DOM                  | FULL                         |\n| Ledger       | 0103           |       | 700    |                     |                       | AR-DOM                  | FULL                         |\n\nHere are the results of the posting:\n\n-   Line 1 has a tax transaction that has a sales tax direction of **Sales tax payable**.\n-   Line 2 has a tax transaction that has a sales tax direction of **Sales tax receivable**.\n-   Line 3 has a tax transaction that has a sales tax direction of **Sales tax receivable**.\n-   Line 4 has a tax transaction that has a sales tax direction of **Sales tax payable**.\n\n## Poland - SSRS VAT register report\nThe **VAT register** report is considered the main tax summary document. The VAT statement is prepared based on this report. It's the main tax reporting audit document in every Polish company. The VAT for sales, purchases, and imported products must be processed separately. The legislation also defines several official reports for VAT and conditions for transactions that must be included on the reports. The **VAT register** report is a basic document that is used in Polish accounting as the basis for reporting taxes to the tax authorities. The VAT registers are printed regularly for reporting periods. (They are usually printed every month.) The reports must be printed on paper, and they must be signed by one or more authorities, such as a chief accountant or a CFO. They are used as the basis for the monthly VAT 7 tax declaration. You can access **VAT register** reports from several places:\n\n-   Tax &gt; Inquiries and reports &gt; Sales tax reports &gt; EU summary VAT register\n-   Tax &gt; Inquiries and reports &gt; Sales tax reports &gt; Purchase VAT register\n-   Tax &gt; Inquiries and reports &gt; Sales tax reports &gt; Sales VAT register\n\n\n\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,758],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"# required metadata\n\ntitle: Sales tax reports for Poland (setting up tax information and other
