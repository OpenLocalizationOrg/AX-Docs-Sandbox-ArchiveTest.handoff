However, the new version of your code won’t be fully functional until a developer resolves any issues that the service identifies but can’t resolve itself.\n\nThe Code upgrade service performs these actions:\n\n- Directly resolve some types of conflict issues.\n- For other issues, log Microsoft Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS) tasks.\n- Create a version of your code in the Finance and Operations format, and check the new version into a new branch of your VSTS project.\n\nIn the Analyze phase, we use the report to help estimate the effort that is required in order to complete code conversion activities.\n\nThe following illustration shows an overview of the process for configuring the Code upgrade service.\n\n![Configuration process for the Code upgrade service](media/codeUpgradeConfigurationProcess.png)\n\nFor information about how to configure the Code upgrade service, see [Configure the code upgrade service in Lifecycle Services](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/dynamics365/unified-operations/dev-itpro/lifecycle-services/configure-execute-code-upgrade).\n\nThe output of the Code upgrade service is designed to be consumed by a Finance and Operations developer. This output will help the developer estimate the effort that is required in order to complete the code upgrade tasks. To form an estimate, the developer must review the tasks that the service generates in VSTS and the new version of the code that the service generates.\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,845],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"# required metadata\n\ntitle: Analyze – Use the Code upgrade service to estimate the effort to upgrade
