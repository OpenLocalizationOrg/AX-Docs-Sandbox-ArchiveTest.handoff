For an example of a suppression file that includes justifications, see &lt;Packages Local Directory&gt;\\\\Directory\\\\Directory\\\\AxIgnoreDiagnosticList\\\\Directory\\_BPSuppressions.xml.                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| Telemetry                                                  | When a model is built, the telemetry framework collects information about Microsoft classes and methods that are referenced by customer and ISV code. This provides Microsoft with much needed information regarding what part of the standard application code is included in backward compatibility requirements.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n| X++ compiler and try catch blocks                          | The X++ compiler now generates code that is slightly different for try catch blocks. Before, the system would catch the DuplicateKey and UpdateConflict exceptions as part of the catch all clause. This introduced some problems that could ultimately lead to data consistency problems if the try catch was used when a transaction is running. Now, the two exceptions mentioned, which are special because they do not roll back a running transaction, are no longer caught in the catch all. For more information, see the blog post [X++, the catch](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/mfp/2016/11/24/x-the-catch/). |\n\n## Personalization\n| Feature                                              | **Why this is important**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n|------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Enhanced administration features for personalization | The personalization administrator can now apply or remove form personalizations for groups of users.
