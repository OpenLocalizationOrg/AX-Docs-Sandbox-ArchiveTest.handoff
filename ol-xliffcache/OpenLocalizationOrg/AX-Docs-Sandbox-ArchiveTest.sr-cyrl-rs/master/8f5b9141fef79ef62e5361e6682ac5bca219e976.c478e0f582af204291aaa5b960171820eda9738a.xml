You can modify the following properties:\n\n- **Label**\n- **Help text**\n- **Country Region Codes**\n- **Extended Data Type** – You can select only extended data types (EDTs) that are derived from the currently selected EDT. The lookup in the property sheet is filtered so that only those EDTs are shown. For example, to edit the EDT on the **Weight** field in the InventTable table, you can create a derived EDT that is based on **BOMMeasureWidth**, and then modify the **Extended Data Type** property on the **Weight** field in the **InventTable** extension. In this way, you can modify the look and feel of the **Width** field in the user interface when the new package is deployed.\n\n![Modify an existing field](media/modify-table-property.jpg) \n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,632],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"# required metadata\n\ntitle: Modify an existing field in a table\ndescription: This topic provides information about how to modify an existing field in a table.\nauthor: ivanv-microsoft\nmanager: AnnBe\nms.date: 07/10/2017\nms.topic: article\nms.prod: \nms.service: dynamics-ax-platform\nms.technology: \n\n\n# optional metadata\n\n# ms.search.form: \n# ROBOTS: \naudience: Developer\n# ms.devlang: \nms.reviewer: robinr\nms.search.scope: Operations, Platform\n# ms.tgt_pltfrm: \nms.custom: 268724\nms.assetid: \nms.search.region: Global\n# ms.search.industry: \nms.author: ivanv\nms.search.validFrom: 2017-02-28\nms.dyn365.ops.version: Platform update 4\n","nodes":[{"content":"Modify an existing field in a table","nodes":[{"pos":[0,35],"content":"Modify an existing field in a table","nodes":[{"content":"Modify an existing field in a table","pos":[0,35]}]}],"path":["title"],"extradata":"MT"},{"content":"This topic provides information about how to modify an existing field in a table.","nodes":[{"pos":[0,81],"content":"This topic provides information about how to modify an existing field in a table.","nodes":[{"content":"This topic provides information about how to modify an existing field in a table.","pos":[0,81]}]}],"path":["description"],"extradata":"MT"}],"header":"# required metadata\n","yml":true},{"pos":[640,675],"content":"Modify an existing field in a table","linkify":"Modify an existing field in a table","nodes":[{"content":"Modify an existing field in a table","pos":[0,35]}]},{"content":"To modify properties on an existing field in a table, you must first create an extension for the table.","pos":[677,780]},{"content":"You can modify the following properties:","pos":[781,821]},{"pos":[825,834],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Label<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept>","source":"**Label**"},{"pos":[837,850],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Help text<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept>","source":"**Help text**"},{"pos":[853,877],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Country Region Codes<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept>","source":"**Country Region Codes**"},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Extended Data Type<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> – You can select only extended data types (EDTs) that are derived from the currently selected EDT.","pos":[880,1001],"source":"**Extended Data Type** – You can select only extended data types (EDTs) that are derived from the currently selected EDT."},{"content":"The lookup in the property sheet is filtered so that only those EDTs are shown.","pos":[1002,1081]},{"content":"For example, to edit the EDT on the <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Weight<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> field in the InventTable table, you can create a derived EDT that is based on <bpt id=\"p2\">**</bpt>BOMMeasureWidth<ept id=\"p2\">**</ept>, and then modify the <bpt id=\"p3\">**</bpt>Extended Data Type<ept id=\"p3\">**</ept> property on the <bpt id=\"p4\">**</bpt>Weight<ept id=\"p4\">**</ept> field in the <bpt id=\"p5\">**</bpt>InventTable<ept id=\"p5\">**</ept> extension.","pos":[1082,1337],"source":" For example, to edit the EDT on the **Weight** field in the InventTable table, you can create a derived EDT that is based on **BOMMeasureWidth**, and then modify the **Extended Data Type** property on the **Weight** field in the **InventTable** extension."},{"content":"In this way, you can modify the look and feel of the <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Width<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> field in the user interface when the new package is deployed.","pos":[1338,1462],"source":" In this way, you can modify the look and feel of the **Width** field in the user interface when the new package is deployed."},{"content":"Modify an existing field","pos":[1466,1490]}]}
