Comments make a program easier to read and understand. Comments are ignored when the program is compiled. Your comments can use either the **//** style or the **/\\***â€¦**\\*/** style. However, a best practice is to use the **//** style for comments, and even for multiline comments.\n\n    // This is an example of a comment.\n    /* Here is another example of a comment. */\n\n## Conditional statements: if, if...else, switch, and ternary operator (?)\nThe conditional statements are **if**, **if**...**else**, **switch**, and the ternary operator (**?**). You use conditional statements to specify whether a block of code is executed. Different conditional statements offer advantages in different situations.\n\n### if and if...else statements\n\nThe **if** statement evaluates a conditional expression, and then executes a statement or a set of statements if the conditional expression is evaluated as **true**. You can use the **else** clause to provide an alternative statement or set of statements that is executed if the condition is evaluated as **false**. Here is the syntax for an **if**...**else** statement:\n\n**if (** *expression* **)** *statement* **\\[ else** *statement* **\\]**\n\nIn this syntax, both occurrences of *statement* can be compound statements. The *expression* in the parentheses (the conditional expression) can be any valid expression that is evaluated as **true** or **false**. All numbers except 0 (zero) are **true**. All non-empty strings are also **true**. You can nest **if** statements. However, if the nesting of **if** statements becomes too deep, you should consider using a **switch** statement instead.\n\n#### Examples of if and if...else statements\n\n    // if statement\n    if(a > 4)\n    {\n       print a;\n    }\n\n    // if... else statement \n    if(a > 4)\n    {\n       print a;\n    }\n    else\n    {\n       print \"a is less than or equal to 4\";\n    }\n\n### switch statements\n\nThe **switch** statement is a multibranch language construct, unlike the **if** statement, where you must nest **if** statements to create the same effect. The conditional expression of the **switch** statement is evaluated and checked against each case value. The case values must be constants that the compiler can evaluate. If a case constant matches the **switch** expression, the **case** statement is executed. If the case also contains a **break** statement, the program then jumps out of the switch. If the case doesn't contain a **break** statement, the program continues and executes the next set of **case** statements. If no matches are found, the **default** statement is executed. If there are no matches and no **default** statement, none of the statements inside the **switch** statement are executed. Here is the syntax for a **switch** statement:\n\n**switch (** *expression* **) { { case } \\[ default:** *statement* **\\] }**\n\nHere is the syntax for a **case** statement:\n\n**case** *expression* **{ ,** *expression* **} :** *statement*\n\nIn the syntax for both a **switch** statement and a **case** statement, every occurrence of s*tatement* can be replaced with a block of statements by enclosing the block in braces ({}).\n\n#### Examples of switch statements\n\n    // When the break keyword is used within a switch statement, the execution of \n    // the case branch terminates, and the statement following the \n    // switch is executed as shown in the following example.\n    // If the Debtor account number is 1000, the program executes \n    // \"do something\", and then continues execution after the switch statement.\n    switch (Debtor.AccountNo)\n    {\n        case \"1000\":\n            // do something\n            break;\n        case \"2000\":\n            // do something else\n            break;\n        default:\n            // default statement\n            break;\n    }\n\n    // Switch statement example to make the execution drop \n    // through case branches by omitting a break statement. \n    // If x is 10, b is assigned to a, and d is assigned to c, the break \n    // statement is omitted after the case 10: statement. If x is 11, d \n    // is assigned to c. If x is 12, f is assigned to e.\n    switch (x)\n    {\n        case 10:\n            a = b;\n        case 11:\n            c = d;\n            break;\n        case 12:\n            e = f;\n            break;\n    }\n\n    // If you do not use the break statement, the program flow in the switch\n    // statement continues into the next case. Code segments A and B\n    // have the same behavior. \n    // Code segment A (break omitted)\n    case 13:\n    case 17:\n    case 21:\n    case 500:\n        print \"g\";\n        break;\n    // Code segment B (the values are comma-delimited)\n    case 13, 17, 21, 500;\n        print \"g\";\n        break;\n\n    // Break statement example within a while loop. When used within\n    // a loop, the loop is terminated and execution continues\n    // from the statement following the loop. This works for do... while\n    // and for loops as well. \n    var mainMenu = SysDictMenu::newMainMenu();\n    var enum = mainMenu.getEnumerator();\n    var found = false;\n    while (enum.moveNext())\n    {\n        var menuItem = enum.current();\n        if (menuItem.label() == \"StringOfInterest\")\n        {\n            found = true;\n            break;\n        }\n    }\n    if (found) \n    {\n        // do something\n    }\n\n### Ternary operator (?)\n\nThe ternary operator (**?**) is a conditional statement that is resolved to one of two expressions. The result can be assigned to a variable. By contrast, an **if** statement provides conditional branching of the program flow but can't be assigned to a variable. Here is the syntax for the ternary operator:\n\n*expression1* **?** *expression2* **:** *expression3*\n\nIn this syntax, *expression1* must return a value of **true** or **false**. If *expression1* is **true**, the whole ternary statement returns *expression2*. Otherwise, the statement returns *expression3*. Both *expression2* and *expression3* must have the same type.\n\n#### Examples of the ternary operator (?)\n\n    // Returns one of two strings based on a Boolean return value from a method call. \n    // The Boolean expression indicated whether the CustTable table has a row\n    // with a RecId field value of 1. If this Boolean expression is true \n    // (meaning RecId != 0), found is assigned to result. \n    // Otherwise, the alternative not found is assigned to result.\n    result = (custTable::find(\"1\").RecId) ? \"found\" : \"not found\";\n     \n    // An example of a nested ternary statement. \n    // If z is not greater than 1000, the expression is equal to the third \n    // expression and low is printed. If AccountNum is greater than 1000, the second \n    // expression is evaluated, and this also contains a ternary operator. If AccountNum \n    // is greater than 1000 and less than 2000, In interval is printed. If AccountNum is \n    // greater than 1000 and greater than or equal to 2000, Above 2000 is printed.str z = \"5\";\n    print( (z > \"1000\") ?\n             ( (z < \"2000\") ? \"In interval\" : \"Above 2000\")\n             : \"low\");\n    ); \n\n## Exception handling: throw, try...catch, finally, and retry\nYou handle errors by using the **throw**, **try**...**catch**, **finally**, and **retry** statements to generate and handle exceptions. An *exception* is a regulated jump away from the sequence of program execution. The instruction where program execution resumes is determined by **try**...**catch** blocks and the type of exception that is thrown. An exception is represented by a value of the **Exception** enumeration. One exception that is often thrown is the **Exception::error** enum value. A common practice is to write diagnostic information to the Infolog before the exception is thrown. The **Global::error** method is often the best way to write diagnostic information to the Infolog. For example, your method might receive an input parameter value that isn't valid. In this case, the method can throw an exception to immediately transfer control to a **catch** code block that contains logic for handling this error situation. You don't necessarily have to know the location of the **catch** block that will receive control when the exception is thrown.\n\n### throw statements\n\nYou use the **throw** keyword to throw an **Exception** enum value. For example, the following statement throws an error exception.\n\n    throw Exception::error;\n\nInstead of throwing an enum value, a best practice is to use the output of the **Global::error** method as the operand for **throw**.\n\n    throw Global::error(\"The parameter value is invalid.\");\n\nThe **Global::error** method can automatically convert a label into the corresponding text. This functionality helps you write code that can be localized more easily.\n\n    throw Global::error(\"@SYS98765\");\n\nThe static methods on the **Global** class can be called without the **Global::** prefix. For example, the **Global::error** method can be called like this.\n\n    error(\"My message.\");\n\n### try, catch, finally, and retry statements\n\nWhen an exception is thrown, it's first processed through the **catch** list of the innermost **try** block. If a **catch** block is found that handles the kind of exception that is being thrown, program control jumps to that **catch** block. If the **catch** list has no block that specifies the exception, the system passes the exception to the **catch** list of the next-innermost **try** block. The **catch** statements are processed in the same sequence as they appear in the code. It's a common practice to have the first **catch** statement handle the **Exception::Error** enum value. One strategy is to have the last **catch** statement leave the exception type unspecified. In this case, the last **catch** statement handles all exceptions that aren't handled by any earlier **catch** statement. This strategy is appropriate for the outermost **try**...**catch** blocks. An optional ****finally**** clause can be included in **try**...**catch** statements. The semantics of a **finally** clause are the same as they are in C\\#. The statements in the **finally** clause are executed when control leaves the **try** block, either normally or through an exception. The **retry** statement can be written only in a **catch** block. The **retry** statement causes control to jump up to the first line of code in the associated **try** block. The **retry** statement is used when the cause of the exception can be fixed by the code in the **catch** block. The **retry** statement gives the code in the **try** block another opportunity to succeed. The **retry** statement erases all messages that have been written to the Infolog since program control entered the **try** block. **Note:** You must make sure that your **retry** statements don't cause an infinite loop. As a best practice, the **try** block should include a variable that you can test to find out whether you're in a loop.\n\n    try \n    { \n        // Code here.\n    }\n    catch (Exception::Numeric) \n    { \n        info(\"Caught a Numeric exception.\"); \n    }\n    catch \n    { \n        info(\"Caught an exception.\"); \n    }\n    finally\n    {\n        // Executed no matter how the try block exits.\n    }\n\n#### The system exception handler\n\nIf no **catch** statement handles the exception, it's handled by the system exception handler. The system exception handler doesn't write to the Infolog. Therefore, an unhandled exception can be hard to diagnose. We recommended that you follow all these guidelines to provide effective exception handling:\n\n-   Have a **try** block that contains all your statements in the outermost frame on the call stack.\n-   Have an unqualified **catch** block at the end of your outermost **catch** list.\n-   Avoid throwing an **Exception** enum value directly.\n-   Throw the enum value that is returned from one of the following methods on the **Global** class: **Global::error**, **Global::warning**, or **Global::info**. (You can omit the implicit **Global::** prefix).\n-   When you catch an exception that hasn't been shown in the Infolog, call the **Global::info** function to show it.\n\n**Exception::CLRError**, **Exception::UpdateConflictNotRecovered**, and system kernel exceptions are examples of exceptions that aren't automatically shown in the Infolog.\n\n#### Exceptions and CLR interop\n\nYou can call Microsoft .NET Framework classes and methods that reside in assemblies that are managed by the common language runtime (CLR). When a .NET Framework **System.Exception** instance is thrown, your code can catch it by referencing **Exception::CLRError**. Your code can obtain a reference to the **System.Exception** instance by calling the **CLRInterop::getLastException** method.\n\n#### Ensuring that exceptions are shown\n\nExceptions of the **Exception::CLRError** type aren't shown in the Infolog, because these exceptions aren't issued by a call to a method such as **Global::error**. In your **catch** block, your code can call **Global::error** to report the specific exception.\n\n### Global class methods\n\nThis section describes some **Global** class methods in more detail. These class methods include **Global::error**, **Global::info**, and **Global::exceptionTextFallThrough**.\n\n#### Global::error method\n\nThe following code shows how the **error** method is declared.\n\n    server client static Exception error\n        (SysInfoLogStr txt,\n        URL helpURL = '',\n        SysInfoAction _sysInfoAction = null)\n\nThe return type is the **Exception::Error** enum value. The **error** method doesn't throw an exception. It just provides an enum value that can be used in a **throw** statement. The **throw** statement throws the exception. Here are descriptions of the parameters for the **error** method. Only the first parameter is required.\n\n-   **SysInfoLogStr** txt is a **str** of the message text. It can also be a label reference, such as **strFmt(\"@SYS12345\", strThingName)**.\n-   The **URL** helpUrl is a reference to the location of a Help topic in Application Explorer, such as **\"KernDoc:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\Functions\\\\\\\\substr\"**. The parameter value is ignored if \\_sysInfoAction is supplied.\n-   The **SysInfoAction** \\_sysInfoAction is an instance of a class that extends the **SysInfoAction** class. The method overrides that we recommend for the child class are the **description** method, the **run** method, the **pack** method, and the **unpack** method.\n\n#### Global::info method\n\nThe **Global::info** method is often used to show text in the Infolog. In programs, it's often written as **info(\"My message.\");**. Although the **info** method returns an **Exception::Info** enum value, you will rarely want to throw **Exception::Info**, because nothing unexpected has occurred.\n\n#### Global::exceptionTextFallThrough method\n\nOccasionally, you want to do nothing inside your **catch** block. However, the X++ compiler generates a warning if you have an empty **catch** block. To avoid this warning, call the **Global::exceptionTextFallThrough** method in the **catch** block. The method does nothing, but it satisfies the compiler.\n\n### Exceptions inside transactions\n\nIf an exception is thrown inside a transaction, the transaction is automatically aborted (that is, a **ttsAbort** operation occurs). This behavior applies for both exceptions that are thrown manually and exceptions that the system throws. When an exception is thrown inside a **ttsBegin**-**ttsCommit** transaction block, no **catch** statement inside that transaction block can process the exception. Instead, the innermost **catch** statements that are outside the transaction block are the first **catch** statements that are tested.\n\n### Examples of exception handling\n\n#### Showing exceptions in the Infolog\n\nThe following code example shows exceptions in the Infolog.\n\n    // This example shows that a direct throw of Exception::Error does not\n    // display a message in the Infolog. This is why we recommend the \n    // Global::error method. \n    static void TryCatchThrowError1Job(Args _args)\n    {\n    /***\n      The 'throw' does not directly add a message to the Infolog.\n      The exception is caught.\n    ***/    \n        try\n        {\n            info(\"In the 'try' block. (j1)\");\n            throw Exception::Error;\n        }\n        catch (Exception::Error)\n        {\n            info(\"Caught 'Exception::Error'.\");\n        }\n\n    /**********  Actual Infolog output\n    Message (03:43:45 pm)\n    In the 'try' block. (j1)\n    Caught 'Exception::Error'.\n    **********/\n    }\n\n#### Using the error method to write exception information to the Infolog\n\nThe following code example uses the **error** method to write exception information to the Infolog.\n\n    // This example shows that the use of the Global::error method \n    // is a reliable way to display exceptions in the Infolog. \n    static void TryCatchGlobalError2Job(Args _args)\n    {\n        /***\n        The 'Global::error()' does directly add a message to the Infolog.\n        The exception is caught.\n        ***/\n        try\n        {\n            info(\"In the 'try' block.

You can make those Infolog messages more helpful by using the **SysInfoAction** class. In the following example, a **SysInfoAction** parameter is passed in to the **Global::error** method. The **error** method writes the message to the Infolog. When the user double-clicks the Infolog message, the **SysInfoAction.run** method is run. In the **run** method, you can write code that helps diagnose or fix the issue that caused the exception. The object that is passed in to the **Global::error** method is constructed from a class that you write that extends **SysInfoAction**. The following code sample is shown in two parts.

A loop repeats its statement until the condition that is set for the loop is **false**. Within the loop statements, you can use **break** and **continue** statements.\n\n### for loops\n\nThe **for** loop repeatedly executes one or more statements for as long as the conditional expression is **true**. The statement is executed as many times as the condition is met. The body of the **for** loop might be executed zero or more times, depending on the results of the condition test. A **for** loop differs from other loops because an initial value can be assigned to a control variable, and because there is a statement for incrementing or decrementing the variable. These additions make a **for** loop especially useful for traversing lists, containers, and arrays, because they have a fixed number of elements. You can also apply a statement to each element and increment your way through the elements, setting the condition to test for the last element. Here is the syntax for a **for** statement:\n\n**for (** *initialization* **;** *test* **;** *increment* **) {** *statement* **}**\n\n*tatement* can be a block of statements.\n\n#### Example of a for loop\n\n    // An example where all items are printed in \n    // a fixed array called ra with 100 reals. \n    int ra[10];\n    int i; // Control variable.\n    for (i=1; i<=100; i+=1)\n    {\n        print ra[i];\n    }\n\n### while loops\n\nA **while** loop repeatedly executes one or more statements for as long as the conditional expression is **true**. The statements are executed as many times as the condition is met (zero to many). Here is the syntax for a **while** loop:\n\n**while (** *expression* **)** *statement*\n\nIn this syntax, *statement* can be replaced by a block of statements.\n\n#### Example of a while loop\n\n    // This example demonstrates a while loop that traverses \n    // a container, cont, and prints out the contents of the container.\n    public static void Iteration()\n    {\n        container cont;\n        int no = 1;\n        while (no <= conlen(cont))\n        {\n            print conpeek(cont,no);\n            no = no + 1;\n        }\n    }\n\n### do...while loops\n\nThe **do**...**while** loop is similar to the **while** loop, but the condition appears after the statements that must be executed. The statements are always executed at least one time, because the condition is tested after the statements are executed. The **do**...**while** loop is well-suited to tasks that must always be done at least one time, such as getting parameters for a report. Here is the syntax for a **do**...**while** loop:\n\n**do {** *statement* **} while (** *expression* **) ;**\n\n*tatement* can be a block of statements.\n\n#### Example of a do...while loop\n\n    // An example of a do...while loop designed to find \n    // the smallest power of 10 that is larger than _Value.\n    int FindPower(real _Value)\n    {\n        int ex=-1;\n        real curVal;\n        ;\n        do\n        {\n            ex += 1;\n            curVal = power(10, ex);\n        }\n        while (_Value>curVal);\n        return ex;\n    }\n\n### continue and break statements\n\nThe **continue** statement causes execution to move directly to the next iteration of a **for**, **while**, or **do**...**while** loop. For **do** or **while**, the test is executed immediately. For a **for** statement, the increment step is executed. The **break** statement within a loop is used to terminate that loop. Execution then moves to the first statement after the loop.\n\n#### Example of a continue statement\n\n    // An example of a continue statement. \n    // If Iarray[i] <= 0, the remaining statements in the loop are not executed, \n    // and i is incremented before the if statement is tried again.\n    int i;\n    int Iarray[100];\n    for (i=1; i<100; i++)\n    {\n        if (Iarray[i] <= 0)\n        continue;\n        // Some statements.\n    }\n\n## print statements\nYou use the **print** statement to show messages (text or selected results) in a temporary window. This window appears when the first **print** statement is executed. During testing, the **print** statement can be a convenient alternative to the **Global::info** method, which shows text in the Infolog. The following table compares the **print** statement and the **Global::info** method.\n\n| Feature                                   | print statement                                                                                                                             | Info method                                                                      |\n|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Ease of invocation                        | The **print** statement automatically converts various data types into strings. It can convert multiple data types in one invocation.       | The **info** method requires that the input parameter be a string.               |\n| Ability to copy contents to the clipboard | The contents of the window that the **print** statement opens can't be copied to the clipboard. You can't give the window focus.            | Infolog contents are easily copied from the **Infolog** window to the clipboard. |\n| Scope of lifetime                         | The window closes when the X++ application ends, and it might close before you have time to read it.                                        | The window persists for the whole client session.                                |\n| Size and location                         | The window can be a specific size and in a specific location on the screen.                                                                 | The window is sized and placed by the system.                                    |\n| Typical usage                             | The **print** statement is used for convenience during testing. It can help you debug small issues without having to run a formal debugger. | The **info** method is appropriate for use in production.                        |\n\n### Example of a print statement\n\n    // This example demonstrates the print statement automatically converting any\n    // date type to a string. \n    static void PrintJob2(Args _args)\n    {\n        str s1 = \"Hello\";\n        int n2 = 42;\n        utcDateTime udt3 = DateTimeUtil::utcNow();\n        Dialog dlog4 = new Dialog();\n        print \"The print statement automatically converts data types to strings.\";\n        print s1, \" -- \", n2, \" -- \", udt3, \" -- \", dlog4;\n        Global::info(\"User clicked 'Yes' to continue to this call to info.\");\n        info(int2Str(n2)); // int2Str converter is needed.\n    }\n    /***  Output to the Print window:\n    The print statement automatically converts data types to strings.\n    Hello -- 42 -- 10/3/2011 09:18:10 pm -- 1\n    ***/\n\n    /***  Output to Infolog window:\n    Message (02:18:10 pm)\n    User clicked 'Yes' to continue to this call to info.\n    ***/\n\n## TODO comments\nThe compiler recognizes the string **TODO** when it occurs at the start of a comment. The **TODO** string prompts the compiler to report the rest of the comment text in the **Task List** window in Microsoft Visual Studio. To open the **Task List** window, select **View**, and then select **Task Window**. The **Task Window** reports the line number where the **TODO** comment can be found in the code. Here are the rules for using **TODO** in comments:\n\n-   The **TODO** string can appear in a comment that uses either the **//** style or the **/\\***...**\\*/** style.\n-   The **TODO** string must be the very first nonâ€“white space string in the comment. A carriage return, a line feed, a tab, and a space are all considered white space.\n-   No white space is required between the start of the comment and the **TODO**.\n-   The **TODO** string is case-insensitive. However, the convention is to type **TODO** in all uppercase letters, instead of **ToDo** or another variation.\n-   The **TODO** string can have any characters appended to it. However, the convention is either to append a colon to the **TODO** string or to follow it with a white space.\n-   The rest of the comment after the **TODO** string is reported as the task description. If the comment is longer than 200 characters, it might appear truncated on the **Tasks** tab.\n-   The **TODO** task description can be spread over multiple lines when the **/\\***...**\\*/** comment style is used.\n\n### Examples of TODO comments\n\nThe following examples show **TODO** comments that use the **//** and **/\\***...**\\*/** styles.\n\n    // An example of using TODO in the // style of comment.\n    public boolean isLate()\n    {\n        // TODO: Finish this stub. \n        return true;\n    }\n\n    // An example of using TODO in the /* */ style of comment.\n    public boolean isLate()\n    {\n        /* TODO Finish this stub */\n        return true;\n    }\n\n## Unsupported statements: changeSite, pause, and window\nThe **changeSite**, **pause**, and **window** keywords are no longer a part of the X++ language. These keywords will cause compilation errors if you use them.\n\n## using clauses\nYou use **using** clauses so that you don't have to provide the fully qualified name of a type. The **using** clause must precede the class that it applies, and it's required in every source file that you want it to apply to. Typically, all **using** clauses are put at the beginning of the source file. You can also provide aliases that introduce a short name for a fully qualified name. Aliases can denote namespaces or classes. The following example shows a **using** clause, a namespace alias, and a class alias.\n\n    using System;\n    using IONS=System.IO; // Namespace alias\n    using Alist=System.Collections.ArrayList; // Class alias\n    public class MyClass2\n    {\n        public static void Main(Args a)\n        {\n            Int32 I; // Alternative to System.Int32\n            Alist al; // Using a class alias\n            al = new Alist();\n            str s;\n            al.Add(1);\n            s = IONS.Path::ChangeExtension(@\"c:\\tmp\\test.xml\", \".txt\");\n        }\n    }\n\n## using statements\nThe **using** statement helps guarantee that objects that implement **IDisposable** are disposed of correctly. When you use an **IDisposable** object, you should declare and instantiate it in a **using** statement. The **using** statement calls the **Dispose** method on the object in the correct way, even if an exception occurs while you're calling methods on the object. You can achieve the same result by putting the object inside a **try** block and then explicitly calling **Dispose** in a **finally** block. The **using** statement simplifies the syntax and disposes of the object correctly. Here is the syntax for a **using** statement:\n\n**using (** *expression* **) {** *statement* **}**\n\nIn this syntax, *statement* can be a block of statements, and *expression* declares and instantiates an object that implements **IDisposable**. The following example creates and uses a **StreamReader** object.\n\n    static void AnotherMethod()\n    {\n        str textFromFile;\n        using (System.IO.StreamReader sr = new System.IO.StreamReader(\"c:\\\\test.txt\"))\n        {\n            textFromFile = sr.ReadToEnd();\n        }\n    }\n\n\n\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,670],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"#
