After this step is complete, you must run the Customization Analysis report. This report analyzes your customization and extension models, and runs a predefined set of best practice rules. \n\nTo generate the Customization Analysis report (CAR), run the following command on a Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations development environment.\n\n    xppbp.exe -metadata=<local packages folder> -all -model=<ModelName> -xmlLog=C:BPCheckLogcd.xml -module=<PackageName> -car=<reportlocation>\n\nHere's an example of how this command might look.\n\n    xppbp.exe -metadata=C:Packages -all -model=MyAppSuiteCustomizations -xmlLog=C:tempBPCheckLogcd.xml -module=ApplicationSuite -car=c:tempCAReport.xlsx\n\nThe xppbp.exe file is located in *c:packagesbin* or *I:AosServicePackagesLocalDirectorybin)*. Any warnings or errors that appear on the **Issues** tab of the report must be resolved. A copy of the CAR report must be submitted to Microsoft prior to your validation meeting.
