You can get to it by accessing the menu item **FMClerkWorkspace**.   The workspace, shown above, has the following items:\n\n-   **Summary** - Contains tiles and a chart.\n-   **Rentals** - Contains a vertical tab control having three pages - the first is selected, and you can see the corresponding content on the rightmost side.\n-   **Statistics** - Contains stacked charts.\n-   **Related links** - Contains a series of grouped menu item links to forms of relevance to this user and activity.\n\nThe overall form, as well as each of the sections within, are defined using UX patterns and subpatterns. The corresponding patterns are described in detail in the following sections.\n\n## Patterns and subpatterns\nWhen building an operational workspace, you must use the patterns and subpatterns defined for that purpose. These patterns and subpatterns are described below. In general, when a control is cited within a pattern's structure, it'll be described as: Common name (ControlType) \\[cardinality\\] If cardinality isn't specified, then the item is required exactly once. Very simple patterns and subpatterns have the structural tree omitted.\n\n### Patterns\n\nThere are the top-level patterns for use with operational workspaces.\n\n#### Workspace Operational\n\nThis is the primary operational workspace pattern and should be applied to the **Design** node of the operational workspace form. It'll prescribe the following structure:\n\n-   Design\n    -   ActionPane (ActionPane) \\[0..\\*\\]\n    -   Workspace Page Filter Group (Group) \\[0..1\\]\n        -   Subpattern: Workspace Page Filter Group\n    -   Panorama (Tab)\n        -   Section Summary Tiles (TabPage)\n            -   Subpattern: Section tiles\n        -   Section Tabbed List (TabPage)\n            -   Subpattern: Section Tabbed List\n        -   Section Charts (TabPage) \\[0..1\\]\n            -   Subpattern: Section Stacked Chart\n        -   Section Related Links (TabPage)\n            -   Subpattern: Section Related Links\n\n#### Form Part Section List\n\nThis pattern is used for **Form Part** forms containing a list. These lists are referenced within the Section Tabbed LIst TabPage in the Worksapce Operational pattern.\n\n-   Design\n    -   Header Group (Group) \\[0..1\\]\n        -   Subpattern: Filters and toolbar - Inline OR Subpattern: Filters and Toolbar - Stacked\n    -   Content Grid (Grid)\n    -   Default Action Button ($Button - any type of button) \\[0..1\\]\n    -   See All Menu Item (MenuFunctionButton) \\[0..1\\]\n\n#### Hub Part Chart\n\nThis pattern is used for **Form Part** forms containing a chart control. These chart forms are referenced within two subpatterns: Section Tiles and Section Stacked Chart. It requires exactly one Chart control.\n\n### Subpatterns\n\n#### Workspace Page Filter Group\n\nThis subpattern is referenced in the pattern Workspace Operational, in Workspace Page Filter Group. It allows for a single input control, which can be used to filter the workspace as a whole.\n\n#### Section Tiles\n\nThis subpattern is referenced in the pattern Workspace Operational, in Section Summary tiles. It allows for both tiles and charts. Any number of those can be defined, in any order. Tiles are defined with TileButton controls, and charts are defined with Form Part controls. A chart Form Part must have dimensions that match those of a normal tile, to ensure the chart flows correctly with the tiles displayed.\n\n#### Section Tabbed List\n\nThis subpattern is referenced in the pattern Workspace Operational, in Section Tabbed List. It allows for multiple list containers to be modeled, each of which ultimately references a Form Part that points to a form containing the desired list. It requires the following structure:\n\n-   Tabbed List (Tab)\n    -   Tabbed List Page (TabPage) \\[0..\\*\\]\n        -   Form Part Section List (FormPartControl). **Note**: The referenced form must use the form pattern, Form Part Section List.\n\n#### Section Stacked Chart\n\nThis subpattern is referenced in the pattern Workspace Operational, in Section Stacked Chart. It allows for up to two charts, which will be rendered in a vertically stacked orientation. It requires the following structure:\n\n-   Tab page (TabPage)\n    -   First Chart FormPart (FormPartControl) \\[0..1\\]\n    -   Second Chart FormPart (FormPartControl) \\[0..1\\]\n\n#### Section Related Links\n\nThis subpattern is referenced in the pattern Workspace Operational, in Section Related Links. It allows for a series of links, with one level of nesting permitted. It requires the following structure:\n\n-   Tab page (TabPage)\n    -   Menu Function Button (MenuFunctionButton) \\[0..\\*\\]\n    -   Links Group (Group) \\[0..\\*\\]\n        -   Menu Function Button (MenuFunctionButton) \\[1..\\*\\]\n\n#### Filters and Toolbar – Inline\n\nThis subpattern is referenced in the pattern Form Part Section List, in Header Group. It allows for some filters and a toolbar, all on the same line. It requires the following structure:\n\n-   Group (Group)\n    -   Filter Group (Group) \\[0..1\\]\n        -   Quick Filter (QuickFilterControl) \\[0..1\\]\n        -   Custom Filter Fields ($Field – any type of field) \\[0..\\*\\]\n    -   Toolbar (ActionPane) \\[0..1\\]\n\n#### Filters and Toolbar - Stacked\n\nThis subpattern is referenced in the pattern Form Part Section List, in the Header Group, It allows for some filter fields on one line, and a toolbar on a line below those filters. It requires the following structure:\n\n-   Group (Group)\n    -   Filter Group (Group) \\[0..1\\]\n        -   Quick Filter (QuickFilterControl) \\[0..1\\]\n        -   Filter Field 1 ($Field - any type of field) \\[0..1\\]\n        -   Filter Field 2 ($Field - any type of field) \\[0..1\\]\n    -   Toolbar (ActionPane) \\[0..1\\]\n\n### Future best practices check\n\nThere are a few best practice (BP) checks that will eventually be built for workspaces. These checks are intended to provide guidance to the user about items that are strongly recommended for performance or design reasons.\n\n#### Filters are covered by indexes\n\nThis check is intended to ensure that any field that is modeled for use as a field on a workspace-wide filter is covered by an index. This will help ensure that performance remains superior when users are taking advantage of these filters.\n\n#### Chart parts only contain OLAP charts\n\nWhen a workspace contains a chat, that chart is be modeled as a separate form, and that form is referenced on the workspace via a Form Part control. The intent of this check is to ensure that any such charts ultimately referenced from a workspace are only using OLAP data.\n\n#### Count tiles have queries defined\n\nA tile caching system has been implemented to improve performance of workspaces, as these forms generally contain several count tiles. For these count tiles to work correctly with the caching system, each tile must have a query defined. That query may be defined on the tile or on the menu item referenced by the tile. The intent of this BP check is to ensure a query is defined in one of these two locations for all count tiles.\n\n\n\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,722],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"#
