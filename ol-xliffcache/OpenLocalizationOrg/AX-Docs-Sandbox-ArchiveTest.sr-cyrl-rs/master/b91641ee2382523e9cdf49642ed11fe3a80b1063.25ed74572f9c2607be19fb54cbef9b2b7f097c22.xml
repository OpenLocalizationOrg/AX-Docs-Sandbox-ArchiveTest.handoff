This topic includes information about purchase duties for legal entities that have their primary address in Austria. For more information about the global sales tax functionality, see [Sales tax overview](../general-ledger/indirect-taxes-overview.md).\n\nThe calculation of purchase duties is based on sales tax codes. To include a sales tax code in the purchase duty calculation, select the **Purchase duty** check box on the **Saxes tax codes** page. \n\nYou can specify purchase duty settings on the **Tax setup** menu on the **Purchase duty** page. You can set the duty identifier (for example, **KU**), description, tax authority, and accounts that will be used for posting. Duty account is a balance account where the liability for the purchase duty is registered. Cost account is a profit and loss account that the costs are posted to and a Settle account where settlement transactions will be generated.\n\nTo specify the value of the purchase duty, click **Purchase duty value** to open the **Purchase duty value** page. You can specify the purchase duty percentage (for example **0,30**) for the required period.\n\nPurchase duties are generated when you settle and post sales taxes. You can generate the **Purchase duty** report from the **Purchase duty reporting** menu.\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,733],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"# required metadata\n\ntitle: Purchase duties\ndescription: A purchase duty is a tax on incoming sales tax and is calculated as a percentage of the paid sales tax.
