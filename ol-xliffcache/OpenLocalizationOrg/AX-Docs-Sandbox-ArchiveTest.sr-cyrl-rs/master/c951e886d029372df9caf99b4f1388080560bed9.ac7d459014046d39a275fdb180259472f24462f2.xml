This method is known as the Incremental method. When this method is turned on, changes that the current feature introduces aren't applied. Unrealized and realized gains or losses are calculated against the last exchange rate that was used. The adjusted amount is used instead of the original amount as the basis of calculation. To switch to the Incremental exchange rate adjustment method, on the **General ledger parameters** page, in the **Foreign currency revaluation** section, in the **Calculation method** field, select **Incremental**. The following example shows how the exchange rate adjustment functionality works for Estonia, Hungary, Czech Republic, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, and Russia. Here is the business scenario for this example:\n\n-   An invoice in a foreign currency is posted on December 1, 2012.\n-   The payment in the foreign currency is posted on January 3, 2013\n-   Settlement is done to apply the payment to the invoice.\n-   Exchange rates adjustment is done on December 31, 2012 (method = Standard).\n-   Exchange rates adjustment is done on January 1, 2013 (method = Invoice date).\n\nHere are the exchange rates for Canadian dollars (CAD) to U.S. dollars (USD) for this example:\n\n-   December 1, 2012: 400.0000\n-   December 31, 2012: 450.0000\n-   January 3, 2013: 420.0000\n\n| Event                                       | Date                             | Debit/credit | Amounts               | General ledger (GL) account    | Transaction type             | Posting type       | Credit | Correction |\n|---------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|--------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------|--------------------|--------|------------|\n| Invoice                                     | 1-Dec-12                         | Debit        | 10,000 CAD/40,000 USD | AR                             | Invoice                      | Customer balance   |        |            |\n| Invoice                                     | 1-Dec-12                         | Credit       | 10,000 CAD/40,000 USD | Offset                         | Invoice                      | Ledger journal     | X      |            |\n| Payment                                     | 3-Jan-13                         | Debit        | 10,000 CAD/42,000 USD | Offset                         | Payment                      | Ledger journal     |        |            |\n| Payment                                     | 3-Jan-13                         | Credit       | 10,000 CAD/42,000 USD | AR                             | Payment                      | Customer balance   | X      |            |\n| Settlement                                  | January 3, 2013 (= payment date) | Debit        | 0 CAD/2,000 USD       | AR                             | Customer                     | Exchange rate gain |        |            |\n| Settlement                                  | January 3, 2013 (= payment date) | Credit       | 0 CAD/2,000 USD       | Realized currency adj profit   | Customer                     | Exchange rate gain | X      |            |\n| Revaluation  (Standard method; date = December 31, 2012) | 31-Dec-12           | Debit        | 0 CAD/5,000 USD       | AR                             | Foreign currency revaluation | Exchange rate gain |        |            |\n| Revaluation  (Standard method; date = December 31, 2012) | 31-Dec-12           | Credit       | 0 CAD/5,000 USD       | Unrealized currency adj profit | Foreign currency revaluation | Exchange rate gain | X      |            |\n| Revaluation  (Standard method; date = December 31, 2012) | 3-Jan-13            | Debit        | 0 CAD/5,000 USD       | AR                             | Foreign currency revaluation | Exchange rate gain |        | X          |\n| Revaluation  (Standard method; date = December 31, 2012) | 3-Jan-13            | Credit       | 0 CAD/5,000 USD       | Unrealized currency adj profit | Foreign currency revaluation | Exchange rate gain | X      | X          |\n\n\n\nFor the preceding revaluation, notice that the entry from January 3, 2013, is a direct reversal of the entry above it (from December 31, 2012).
