This is a strength of the product which historically has been supported through overlayering of the application code. The move to the cloud with more agile servicing and frequent updates requires a less intrusive customization model that makes updates less likely to impact custom solutions. This new model is called extensibility and will ultimately replace customization by overlayering.\n\n## Introduction\n\nIntroduction contains general information about how Dynamics 365 for Operations supports customization, including information on when customization transitions from overlayering to purely extension based. Here is also described how you can log extensibility requests to Microsoft; along with a general frequent questions and answers.\n\n+ [Application extensibility plans](extensibility-roadmap.md)\n+ [Next steps - extensibility requests](extensibility-requests.md) \n+ [FAQ](app-sealing-faq.md) \n\n## Getting started\n\nGetting started gets you going with building extensions. Here is also information on migrating a current solution based on overlayered code to an extension based solution. This section also includes hands on labs that lets you walk through simple customizations.\n\n+ [Migrate from overlayering to extensions](migrate-overlayer-extension.md)\n+ [Customize model elements using extensions (tutorial)](customize-model-elements-extensions.md)\n+ [Customization: overlayering and extensions](customization-overlayering-extensions.md)\n+ [Customize by overlayering metadata source code (Office Mix)](https://mix.office.com/watch/1ol6ov90jrd4w)\n\n## Extensibility fundamentals\n\nExtensibility fundamentals includes principles and practices for how to make extensions. The guiding principles discuss how customization must be approached through extensions; including naming guidelines. Additionally topics discuss foundation frameworks like extensions and chain of command.\n\n+ [Intrusive customizations](intrusive-customizations.md)\n+ [Class extensions](class-extensions.md)\n+ [Naming guidelines](naming-guidelines-extensions.md)\n\n## How do I..?\n\nHere is where you find \"How do I?\" topics on customizing specific object types or code. Most of these topics are brief and to the point. There are many topics here so searching for a particular topic may be practical.\n\n### Data types\n+ [Add an enum value](add-enum-value.md)\n+ [Modify an extended data type](modify-edt.md) \n\n### Classes\n+ [Register a subclass for factory methods](register-subclass-factory-methods.md)\n+ [Respond with EventHandlerResult](respond-event-handler-result.md)\n+ [Extend the RunBase class](extend-runbase-class.md)\n\n### Tables\n+ [Modify an existing field in a table](modify-existing-field.md)\n+ [Add a new field to an existing table](add-field-extension.md)\n+ [Add an index to an existing table](add-index.md)\n+ [Add a relation to an existing table](add-relation.md)\n+ [Modify properties on an existing table](modify-properties.md)\n+ [Add a method to a table](add-method-table.md)\n+ [Perform business actions throughout the lifecycle of a table record](subscribe-table-events.md)\n\n### Forms\n+ [Add a new data source to a form](add-datasource.md)\n+ [Change the caption on a form](change-caption-form.md)\n+ [Modify form control properties](modify-control-properties.md)\n\n### Reports\n+ [Extend the list of Electronic reporting functions](../analytics/general-electronic-reporting-formulas-list-extension.md)\n+ [Customize App Suite reports](../analytics/customize-app-suite-reports-with-extensions.md)\n\n### Labels\n+ [Change a label](change-label.md)\n\n## Blog posts\n\nInformation on Customization is also shared through various blogs where different topics are discussed. This section includes reference to some of these.\n\n+ [Extending Dynamics 365 for Operations](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/mfp/2017/01/31/extending-dynamics-365-for-operations/)\n+ [Extending
