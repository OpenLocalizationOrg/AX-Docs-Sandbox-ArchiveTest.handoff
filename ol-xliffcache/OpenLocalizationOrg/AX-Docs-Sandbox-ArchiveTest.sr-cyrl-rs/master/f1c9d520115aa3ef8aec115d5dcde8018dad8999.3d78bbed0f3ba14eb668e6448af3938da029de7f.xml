You can generate an NF-e from any of the following fiscal documents:\n\n-   Sales orders\n-   Purchase orders for non-taxpayer vendors\n-   Project invoices\n-   Tax fiscal documents\n-   Free text invoices\n\nBefore you can generate an NF-e, you must complete the following tasks:\n\n-   Set up web services, rejection codes, and schemas for a domain.\n-   For each fiscal establishment, set up a certificate, an environment, an NF-e version, an authority, a template, schema validation, and a contingency mode for NF-e. Additionally, set up automatic printing of the Documento auxiliar da Nota fiscal eletrônica (DANFE), so that the DANFE is automatically printed after NF-e approval.\n-   Set up web services that are related to a fiscal authority.\n-   Set up a fiscal document type for an NF-e.\n\nAfter you generate an NF-e, you can submit the digitally signed NF-e to the Secretaria da Fazenda (SEFAZ) in an XML message. The items can be delivered after the NF-e is electronically approved by SEFAZ. The NF-e process includes the following steps:\n\n1.  The fiscal establishment posts a fiscal document by using a fiscal document type that is set up for fiscal document model 55 to generate an NF-e.\n2.  The NF-e export or import process detects the posted fiscal document for the fiscal document model 55 and generates an XML message in the specified format. A separate XML message is generated for each NF-e. The XML message is transmitted to SEFAZ.\n3.  SEFAZ processes the XML message and returns a protocol and status for each NF-e. The NF-e status and protocol are then assigned to the NF-e that is used in the NF-e export or import process. The status that is returned can be **Approved**, **Denied**, **Discarded**, **Canceled**, **Rejected non fixable**, or **Rejected**. This information is used to update the fiscal document status in Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, Enterprise edition.\n\nAfter the status of the NF-e is received from SEFAZ, you can perform the following tasks, depending on the status:\n\n-   If the NF-e is approved, you can print the DANFE. Alternatively, if the **Print DANFE when NF-e is approved** option is selected on the **NF-e federal** FastTab of the **Fiscal establishments** page, the DANFE is printed automatically.\n-   If the NF-e is denied, you must cancel the NF-e.\n-   If the NF-e is rejected and can be fixed, you can correct the incorrect information, and then click **Resend** on the **NF-e federal** tab of the **Fiscal document** page to resend the NF-e to SEFAZ.\n-   If the NF-e is rejected and can't be fixed, you must cancel the discarded NF-e that has discarded number. The NF-e export or import process detects the fiscal document that is posted and marked for discard, and then generates an XML message in the specified format for the discarded NF-e number. This XML message is then transmitted to SEFAZ, and the fiscal document status is set to **Discarded**.\n\n\n\n\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,984],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"# required
