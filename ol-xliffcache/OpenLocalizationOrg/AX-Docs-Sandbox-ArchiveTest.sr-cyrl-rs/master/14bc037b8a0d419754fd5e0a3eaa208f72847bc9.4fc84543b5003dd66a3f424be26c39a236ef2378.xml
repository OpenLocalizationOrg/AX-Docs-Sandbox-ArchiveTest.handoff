A process data package (PDP) that is available in Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services (LCS) includes links to the following menu items. This PDP will fill in the **Data validation checklist** workspace. The **Data validation checklist** workspace lets users track a project and monitor the tasks that are required in order to complete it.\n\n## Document management\n\nIf you use Document management, existing documents or attachments that are stored in the database must be migrated to Microsoft Azure Blob storage. To complete this migration, use the **Migrate files** button on the **Migrate files** tab on the **Document management parameters** page.\n\n## Print management\n\nIf you use Print management, the references to network printers from AX 2012 won’t be valid. You must set up and reference network printers on the **Document routing** page. For more information, see [Install the Document Routing Agent to enable network printer devices](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/unified-operations/dev-itpro/analytics/install-document-routing-agent).\n\n## Retail\n\nAfter you complete the upgrade from AX 2012, you must configure registers and devices.\n\nTo configure a register, click **Retail** > **Channels** > **Retail stores**. Select the row for the retail channel, and then expand the **Registers** FactBox. Click **More**, click **New**, and complete the setup of the register.\n\nTo configure a device, click **Retail** > **Channel setup** > **POS Setup**, and then click **New**.\n\nAdditionally, you must run all jobs (9999) for the channel database. Click **Retail** > **Headquarters setup** > **Retail scheduler** > **Channel database**. Select the row for the appropriate channel database, and then click **Full data sync**. Select the **9999** (**All jobs**) distribution schedule, and then click **OK**. Click **OK** again to run the job.\n\n## Service industries\n\nAfter you complete the upgrade from AX 2012, you must set up resource capacity roll-up and project ledger intercompany posting.\n\nTo run the Resource capacity roll-up batch job, click **Project management and accounting** > **Inquiries and reports** > **Capacity synchronization**. You must run this batch job to set up the resource and resource calendar reservation data. This data will be required if you use project resource scheduling. For more information, see [Project resourcing](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/unified-operations/financials/project-management/project-resourcing).\n\nTo enable project ledger intercompany posting, click **Project management and accounting** > **Setup** > **Posting** > **Ledger posting setup**. On the **Cost accounts** tab, in the **Ledger account types** field, select **Intercompany cost**, and then enter the details of the lending legal entity. On the **Revenue accounts** tab, in the **Ledger account types** field, select **Intercompany revenue**, and then enter details of the borrowing legal entity.\n\n## Budget planning\n\nAfter you complete the upgrade from AX 2012, you must set up Budget planning columns and layouts. To complete this setup, click **Budgeting** > **Setup** > **Budget planning** > **Budget planning configuration**.\n\nAdditionally, you must update Budget planning processes so that they use the appropriate layout for each budget stage. To update Budget planning processes, click **Budgeting** > **Setup** > **Budget planning** > **Budget planning process**.\n\nFor more information about Budget planning upgrade, see [Upgrading to Budget planning from Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012](/dynamics365/unified-operations/dev-itpro/migration-upgrade/upgrade-budget-planning).\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,766],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"# required metadata\n\ntitle:
