Hungarian tax law defines the limit (threshold) for low-cost assets. These assets can be fully depreciated at the same time that they are acquired.\n\n## Set up parameters for lowcost fixed assets\n### Set up the low-cost asset threshold\n\nTo set up the limit for low-cost assets, click **Fixed assets** &gt; **Setup** &gt; **Fixed assets parameters**. Then, in the **Low-cost asset threshold** field, enter the value limit for low-cost assets.\n\n### Set up books\n\nWhen you create an acquisition transaction for an asset that uses the book for low-cost assets, depreciation is generated automatically.\n\n1.  Click **Fixed assets** &gt; **Setup** &gt; **Books**.\n2.  Select the book for low-cost assets, and select the **Low-cost asset** check box.\n\n**Note:** Only value models that use the \"Manual\" or \"Straight line service life\" depreciation profiles/global methods, or the Hungary-specific \"Straight line (Hu)\" method, are available for low-cost depreciation.\n\n### Generate acquisition and depreciation transactions for low-cost fixed assets\n\nWhen you acquire an asset, you create an acquisition transaction from the pre-acquisition transaction. When you post the acquisition transaction for a low-cost asset, the depreciation transaction is generated automatically.\n\n\n\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,616],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"# required metadata\n\ntitle: Low-cost fixed assets\ndescription: This topic provides information about low-cost fixed assets for Hungary.\nauthor: ShylaThompson\nmanager: AnnBe\nms.date: 06/20/2017\nms.topic: article\nms.prod: \nms.service: dynamics-ax-applications\nms.technology: \n\n# optional metadata\n\n# ms.search.form: \n# ROBOTS: \naudience: Application User\n# ms.devlang: \nms.reviewer: shylaw\nms.search.scope: Core, Operations, UnifiedOperations\n# ms.tgt_pltfrm: \nms.custom: 264684\nms.search.region: Hungary\n# ms.search.industry: \nms.author: epopov\nms.search.validFrom: 2016-11-30\nms.dyn365.ops.version: Version 1611\n","nodes":[{"content":"Low-cost fixed assets","nodes":[{"pos":[0,21],"content":"Low-cost fixed assets","nodes":[{"content":"Low-cost fixed assets","pos":[0,21]}]}],"path":["title"],"extradata":"MT"},{"content":"This topic provides information about low-cost fixed assets for Hungary.","nodes":[{"pos":[0,72],"content":"This topic provides information about low-cost fixed assets for Hungary.","nodes":[{"content":"This topic provides information about low-cost fixed assets for Hungary.","pos":[0,72]}]}],"path":["description"],"extradata":"MT"}],"header":"# required metadata\n","yml":true},{"pos":[624,645],"content":"Low-cost fixed assets","linkify":"Low-cost fixed assets","nodes":[{"content":"Low-cost fixed assets","pos":[0,21]}]},{"content":"This topic provides information about low-cost fixed assets for Hungary.","pos":[691,763]},{"content":"A low-cost asset is an asset for which the acquisition cost doesn't exceed a predefined amount.","pos":[765,860]},{"content":"Hungarian tax law defines the limit (threshold) for low-cost assets.","pos":[861,929]},{"content":"These assets can be fully depreciated at the same time that they are acquired.","pos":[930,1008]},{"pos":[1013,1055],"content":"Set up parameters for lowcost fixed assets","linkify":"Set up parameters for lowcost fixed assets","nodes":[{"content":"Set up parameters for lowcost fixed assets","pos":[0,42]}]},{"pos":[1060,1095],"content":"Set up the low-cost asset threshold","linkify":"Set up the low-cost asset threshold","nodes":[{"content":"Set up the low-cost asset threshold","pos":[0,35]}]},{"content":"To set up the limit for low-cost assets, click <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Fixed assets<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> <ph id=\"ph1\">&amp;gt;</ph> <bpt id=\"p2\">**</bpt>Setup<ept id=\"p2\">**</ept> <ph id=\"ph2\">&amp;gt;</ph> <bpt id=\"p3\">**</bpt>Fixed assets parameters<ept id=\"p3\">**</ept>.","pos":[1097,1209],"source":"To set up the limit for low-cost assets, click **Fixed assets** &gt;
