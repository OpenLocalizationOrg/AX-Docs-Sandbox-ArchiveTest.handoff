For example, to add a field that holds the radius of the released product, you must create an extension for the InventTable table in your model, as shown in the following illustration.\n\n![Create an extension](media/TableNewField01.jpg) \n\nYou can now add the field to the extension, just as you would add a field to a table in your model. You can use two methods:\n\n+ In the designer, right-click the **Fields** node, select **New**, and then select the type of field to add.\n+ Drag an existing Extended Data Type or Base Enumeration from your project onto the **Fields** node.\n\nWhen you've finished, you can modify the properties of the new field. In the following illustration, only the **Label** property was modified.\n\n![Modify properties of the new field](media/TableNewField02.jpg)\n\nYou can now optionally add the new field either to one of the existing field groups or to a new field group that you create. In the following illustration, the **Radius** field was added to the **PhysicalDimensions** field group.\n\n![Add the new field to a field group](media/TableNewField03.jpg)\n\nAfter compilation and synchronization of the database, you can see and edit the new field in the user interface.\n\n![New field in the user interface](media/TableNewField04.jpg)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,628],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"# required metadata\n\ntitle: Add a new field to an existing table\ndescription: This topic describes how to use a table extension to add a field to a table.\nauthor: ivanv-microsoft\nmanager: AnnBe\nms.date: 06/20/2017\nms.topic: article\nms.prod: \nms.service: dynamics-ax-platform\nms.technology: \n\n\n# optional metadata\n\n# ms.search.form: \n# ROBOTS: \naudience: Developer\n# ms.devlang: \nms.reviewer: robinr\nms.search.scope: Operations, Platform\n# ms.tgt_pltfrm: \nms.custom: 268724\nms.assetid: \nms.search.region: Global\n# ms.search.industry: \nms.author: ivanv\nms.search.validFrom: 2017-06-01\nms.dyn365.ops.version: Platform update 4\n","nodes":[{"content":"Add a new field to an existing table","nodes":[{"pos":[0,36],"content":"Add a new field to an existing table","nodes":[{"content":"Add a new field to an existing table","pos":[0,36]}]}],"path":["title"],"extradata":"MT"},{"content":"This topic describes how to use a table extension to add a field to a table.","nodes":[{"pos":[0,76],"content":"This topic describes how to use a table extension to add a field to a table.","nodes":[{"content":"This topic describes how to use a table extension to add a field to a table.","pos":[0,76]}]}],"path":["description"],"extradata":"MT"}],"header":"# required metadata\n","yml":true},{"pos":[636,672],"content":"Add a new field to an existing table","linkify":"Add a new field to an existing table","nodes":[{"content":"Add a new field to an existing table","pos":[0,36]}]},{"content":"To add a new field to an existing table, you must first create a table extension.","pos":[674,755]},{"content":"For example, to add a field that holds the radius of the released product, you must create an extension for the InventTable table in your model, as shown in the following illustration.","pos":[756,940]},{"content":"Create an extension","pos":[944,963]},{"content":"You can now add the field to the extension, just as you would add a field to a table in your model.","pos":[994,1093]},{"content":"You can use two methods:","pos":[1094,1118]},{"pos":[1122,1229],"content":"In the designer, right-click the <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Fields<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> node, select <bpt id=\"p2\">**</bpt>New<ept id=\"p2\">**</ept>, and then select the type of field to add.","source":"In the designer, right-click the **Fields** node, select **New**, and then select the type of field to add."},{"pos":[1232,1331],"content":"Drag an existing Extended Data Type or Base Enumeration from your project onto the <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Fields<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> node.","source":"Drag an existing Extended Data Type or Base Enumeration from your project onto the **Fields** node."},{"content":"When you've finished, you can modify the properties of the new field.","pos":[1333,1402]},{"content":"In the following illustration, only the <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Label<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> property was modified.","pos":[1403,1475],"source":" In the following illustration, only the **Label** property was modified."},{"content":"Modify properties of the new field","pos":[1479,1513]},{"content":"You can now optionally add the new field either to one of the existing field groups or to a new field group that you create.","pos":[1543,1667]},{"content":"In the following illustration, the <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Radius<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> field was added to the <bpt id=\"p2\">**</bpt>PhysicalDimensions<ept id=\"p2\">**</ept> field group.","pos":[1668,1772],"source":" In the following illustration, the **Radius** field was added to the **PhysicalDimensions** field group."},{"content":"Add the new field to a field group","pos":[1776,1810]},{"content":"After compilation and synchronization of the database, you can see and edit the new field in the user interface.","pos":[1840,1952]},{"content":"New field in the user interface","pos":[1956,1987]}]}
