Click **Fixed assets** &gt; **Setup** &gt; **Depreciation** &gt; **Depreciation profiles**.\n2.  Click **New** to create a depreciation profile.\n3.  In the **Method** field, select **Regular CZ** or **Accelerated CZ**.\n4.  In the **Depreciation year** field, select **Calendar** as the basis for the calculation of depreciation.\n5.  In the **Period frequency** field, select **Yearly**.\n\n## Apply the halfyearly depreciation method\nAfter you set up the depreciation methods, you can apply half the yearly depreciation for assets that were disposed of.\n\n1.  Click **Fixed assets** &gt; **Journals** &gt; **Fixed assets**.\n2.  On the **Overview** tab, click **New** to create a journal, and then enter the required details.\n3.  Click **Lines** to open the **Journal voucher** page.\n4.  Create a journal line for the fixed asset that was sold or otherwise disposed of.\n5.

When this check box is selected, the yearly depreciation amount is divided by two and rounded according to the rounding setup for the depreciation book.\n8.  Optional: Select the **Summarize depreciation** check box to summarize the calculated depreciation for each fixed asset or for each value model.\n9.
