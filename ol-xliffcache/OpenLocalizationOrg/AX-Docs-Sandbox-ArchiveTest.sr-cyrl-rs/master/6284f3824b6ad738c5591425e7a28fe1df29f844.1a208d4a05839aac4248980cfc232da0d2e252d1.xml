Administrators of an organization can follow these steps to have the links to their legal terms and privacy statement be available in the **About **pane (**Settings** &gt; **About**).\n\n## Add links\nGo to the **System parameters** page and click **Legal and Privacy**. On this page you can:\n\n-   Enter the link to a page that outlines the legal terms for your organization.\n-   Enter the link to a page that outlines the privacy statement for your organization.\n\n**Note:** Make sure that you enter the full URL, starting with either https or http. \n\nClick **Save**.\n\n## Validate links\nTo validate that the links have been added, on the toolbar at the top of the page, click the **Settings** icon, and then click **About**. In the **Links** section of the pane, you should see two new links:\n\n-   **Your organization’s Legal terms**\n-   **Your organization’s Privacy and Cookies**\n\nClick on these links to validate that they open the appropriate pages. \n\n**Note:** The links open in a new window, so if you have a pop-up blocker enabled, you will have to add an exception to your pop-up blocker settings to allow Finance and Operations to launch a new window.\n\n\n\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,825],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"# required metadata\n\ntitle: Add links to your organization's legal terms and privacy statement\ndescription: This topic explains how administrators can add links to their organization's legal terms and privacy statement in the <strong>About</strong> pane of Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations.\nauthor: aneesmsft\nmanager: AnnBe\nms.date: 06/20/2017\nms.topic: article\nms.prod: \nms.service: dynamics-ax-platform\nms.technology: \n\n# optional metadata\n\n# ms.search.form: \n# ROBOTS: \naudience: IT Pro\n# ms.devlang: \nms.reviewer: sericks\nms.search.scope: Core, AX 7.0.0, Operations, UnifiedOperations\n# ms.tgt_pltfrm: \nms.custom: 267894\nms.assetid: b74f8d8b-e20b-4ffd-8fd6-c64c2fe31c8a\nms.search.region: Global\n# ms.search.industry: \nms.author: aneesa\nms.search.validFrom: 2016-02-28\nms.dyn365.ops.version: AX 7.0.0\n","nodes":[{"content":"Add links to your organization's legal terms and privacy statement","nodes":[{"pos":[0,66],"content":"Add links to your organization's legal terms and privacy statement","nodes":[{"content":"Add links to your organization's legal terms and privacy statement","pos":[0,66]}]}],"path":["title"],"extradata":"MT"},{"content":"This topic explains how administrators can add links to their organization's legal terms and privacy statement in the <strong>About</strong> pane of Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations.","nodes":[{"pos":[0,199],"content":"This topic explains how administrators can add links to their organization's legal terms and privacy statement in the &lt;strong&gt;About&lt;/strong&gt;
