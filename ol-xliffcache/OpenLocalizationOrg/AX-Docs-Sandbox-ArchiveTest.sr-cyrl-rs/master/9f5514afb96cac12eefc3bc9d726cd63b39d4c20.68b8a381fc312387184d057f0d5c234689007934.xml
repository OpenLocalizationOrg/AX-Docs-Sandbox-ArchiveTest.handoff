For more information about conditional tax, see [Sales tax overview](../general-ledger/indirect-taxes-overview.md). A *promissory note* is a written agreement in which the maker of the note promises to pay a specific amount at a specific time. A *bill of exchange* is a written or electronic order from a customer that specifies that another party (usually a bank) should pay a stated amount to the company. For more information about bills of exchange, see [Set up bills of exchange](../accounts-receivable/set-up-bills-exchange.md).\n\n## Conditional sales tax for protested promissory notes\nWhen a user posts a Redraw promissory note journal, transactions that were previously posted are reversed if a promissory note was settled against a vendor invoice. If the invoice included conditional tax when it was settled against a promissory note, a tax transaction for the conditional tax is posted. For legal entities in Spain, if the promissory note was settled against an invoice that includes conditional tax, the tax transaction is reversed when a Redraw promissory note journal is posted. To view reverse transactions, go to **Voucher transactions** &gt; **Related vouchers**.\n\n## Conditional sales tax for protested bills of exchange\nWhen a user posts a Protest bill of exchange journal, transactions that were previously posted are reversed if a bill of exchange was settled against a customer invoice.
