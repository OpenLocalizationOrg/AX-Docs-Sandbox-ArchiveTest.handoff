This article describes the Open in new window feature that is available in the web client. This feature lets users view the data from multiple pages in a side-by-side format.

In some scenarios, users might find it useful to view the data from multiple pages in a side-by-side format. The web client provides an **Open in new window** feature that enables these scenarios to help users complete their tasks more efficiently. The **Open in new window** button is located next to the **Close** button on the Action Pane. 

For example, an Accounts receivable clerk who works with sales orders wants to inspect a number of sales orders and the associated sales tax transactions. The user navigates to the list of sales orders and then, on the Action Pane, clicks **Sell** &gt; **Tax** &gt; **Sales tax** to open the **Sales tax transactions** page. The user then clicks **Open in new window**. The **Sales tax transactions** page opens in a new browser window, and the main window shows the list of sales orders again. 

The user can now keep the two windows side by side. When a new sales order is selected in the main window, the **Sales tax transactions** page in the other window is automatically updated to show the corresponding sales tax transactions. Therefore, the user doesn't have to navigate back and forth between pages.
