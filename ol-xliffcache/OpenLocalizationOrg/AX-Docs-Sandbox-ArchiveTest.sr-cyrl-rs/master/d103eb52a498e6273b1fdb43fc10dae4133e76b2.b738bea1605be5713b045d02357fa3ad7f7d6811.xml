It also shows you how to get supply information related to an item. Physical on-hand inventory is the on-hand inventory that’s available – that is, it’s purchased, received and registered. On-hand inventory includes the available on-hand inventory, but also the inventory that’s been ordered and is expected, but not yet received or registered. You can walk through this procedure in demo data company USMF, or using your own data. If you are using USMF you can use the example values that are shown. These tasks would typically be carried out by a warehouse worker.\n\n\n## Check on-hand inventory for an item\n1. Go to Inventory management > Inquiries and reports > On-hand inventory.\n2.
