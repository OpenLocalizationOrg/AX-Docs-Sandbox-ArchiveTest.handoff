To deploy the environment, you’ll use the Cloud-hosted environments tool in Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services.\n\nPrerequisites\n-------------\n\nBefore you complete the procedures in this article, make sure that the following prerequisites are in place.\n\n| Category       | Prerequisite                                                                                                                                                    |\n|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Required tasks | [Plan your Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3 deployment on Azure](plan-2012-r3-deployment-azure.md) |\n\n## 1. Log on to Lifecycle Services\nMicrosoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services provides a cloud-based collaborative workspace that customers and partners can use to manage Microsoft Dynamics AX projects. You’ll use this website to deploy Dynamics AX on Azure. Lifecycle Services is available to customers and partners as part of their support plans. You can access it with your CustomerSource or PartnerSource credentials. [Log on to Lifecycle Services](https://lcs.dynamics.com/en/)\n\n## 2. Create a project\nAfter you log in to Lifecycle Services, open an existing project, or create a new project. Projects are the key organizer of your experience in Lifecycle Services. The methodology associated with a project determines which phases and tasks are included in the project by default.\n\n## 3. Connect the project to your Azure subscription\nConnect the Lifecycle Services project to your Azure subscription. This will enable Lifecycle Services to deploy a Dynamics AX 2012R3 environment to the subscription. To connect the project to your Azure subscription, complete the following procedure. Keep in mind that a project can be connected to only one Azure subscription. If you have multiple Azure subscriptions, be sure to identify which subscription you want to use before you complete this procedure.\n\n1.  Click **Cloud-hosted environments**. The **Cloud-hosted environments** page is displayed.\n2.  The **Microsoft Azure setup** panel is displayed on the side of the screen. If it is not displayed, click **Microsoft Azure settings**.\n3.  Enter your Azure subscription ID. If you need to find your subscription ID, complete the following steps:\n    1.  Open another instance of your browser.\n    2.  Log on to the [Azure management portal](https://manage.windowsazure.com/).\n    3.  In the navigation pane on the left, click **Settings**. (You may have to scroll to the bottom of the navigation pane to see the Settings link.) The **Settings** page is displayed.\n    4.  Copy your subscription ID, and then paste it into the **Azure subscription ID** field in Lifecycle Services (which is currently displayed in another browser instance).\n\n4.  Click **Next**.\n5.  Click **Download** to download a management certificate. This management certificate enables Lifecycle Services to communicate with Azure on your behalf. By default, the management certificate is saved to the Downloads folder on your computer and is named LifecycleServicesDeployment.cer.\n6.  Upload the management certificate to Azure. To do so, complete the following steps:\n    1.  Open another instance of your browser. (Or, go to the browser instance that you may have opened in step 3.)\n    2.  Log on to the [Azure management portal](https://manage.windowsazure.com/).\n    3.  In the navigation pane on the left, click **Settings**. The **Settings** page is displayed.\n    4.  Click **Management certificates**.\n    5.  Click **Upload** at the bottom of the page.\n    6.  In the **Upload a management certificate** window, browse to the management certificate that you downloaded in step 5. Then click the check mark.\n\n7.  Go back to the browser that displays the **Microsoft Azure setup** panel in Lifecycle Services. Click **Next**.\n8.  Select the region that is closest to you. The Dynamics AX  environment will be deployed to a datacenter in this region.\n9.  Click **Connect**. The project is now connected to the Azure subscription that you specified. If you discover that you connected the project to the wrong Azure subscription (that is, assuming you have multiple Azure subscriptions), you’ll need to delete the project, create a new project, and then repeat this procedure to connect the new project to the appropriate Azure subscription.\n\n## 4. Deploy a Retail essentials dev/test environment on Azure\nComplete the following procedure to deploy a Retail essentials dev/test environment on Azure.\n\n1.  On the **Cloud-hosted environments** page, click the **Add** (**+**) icon.\n2.  In the **Select environment topology** panel, select **Dev/Test**.\n3.  Click **Retail essentials dev/test**.\n4.  In the **Environment name** field, enter a name for the environment that will be deployed.\n5.  Click **Advanced settings**.\n6.  To customize domain settings, click **Customize domain settings**. Then use the following table to enter information.\n    <table>\n    <colgroup>\n    <col width=\"50%\" />\n    <col width=\"50%\" />\n    </colgroup>\n    <thead>\n    <tr class=\"header\">\n    <th>If you want to:</th>\n    <th>Do this:</th>\n    </tr>\n    </thead>\n    <tbody>\n    <tr class=\"odd\">\n    <td>Create a new domain in Azure for the environment</td>\n    <td><ol>\n    <li>Click <strong><span class=\"label\">New domain</span></strong>.</li>\n    <li>Enter a name for the domain. By default, the domain is named <em>contoso.com</em>.</li>\n    </ol></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr class=\"even\">\n    <td>Add the environment to an existing domain in Azure</td>\n    <td><ol>\n    <li>Click <strong><span class=\"label\">Existing domain</span></strong>.</li>\n    <li>Enter the name of the domain. For example, <em>contoso.com</em>.</li>\n    </ol></td>\n    </tr>\n    </tbody>\n    </table>\n\n7.  To customize the service accounts that will be created in the domain, click **Customize service accounts**. Service accounts and/or service account passwords may be specified through the **Advanced Settings** option for a deployment. If neither is provided, default accounts are used and random passwords are selected. Use these features when you want to maintain account naming and password rules for your corporation. Account and password rules:\n    -   A valid service name must be less than 20 characters with no special characters.\n    -   A valid password must be more than 8 characters and contain uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and at least one of the following characters: \\['@', '!', '=', '\\*'\\]You can’t use common passwords, such as: pass@word1\n\n8.  To select the version of AX 2012 R3 that you want use, click **Supported version**. By default, the AX 2012 R3 CU8 version of this environment will be deployed. If you don’t want to use the CU8 version, select **Dynamics ERP 2012 R3 RTM** from the list.\n9.  To customize virtual machine names, click **Customize virtual machine names**. In order to support common IT naming guidelines, the ability to name virtual machines is provided through the **Advanced settings** option on most deployment topologies. In addition to defining the name, a starting index can be selected for each virtual machine type. The index is incremented for each instance of the virtual machine type that is deployed. Virtual machine names must be 13 characters or less. The index is separated from the machine name by a hyphen (-), followed by the index that supports a maximum of 2 digits. Example: ACustomVMName-99. When virtual machine instances are added to an environment after the initial deployment, the deployment service will start incrementing the virtual machine name where it left off. For example, if you deployed four AOS virtual machines with a starting index of 2, then the last AOS instance name will be AOS-6. If you add two more AOS instances, they will be AOS-7 and AOS-8.If one of the virtual machine types in your deployment is customized, then all of the virtual machine names must be customized. This is done to ensure that a long deployment does not occur because a virtual machine name was accidentally missed.\n10. To customize virtual network settings, click **Customize virtual network**. Then use the following table to enter information.\n    <table>\n    <colgroup>\n    <col width=\"50%\" />\n    <col width=\"50%\" />\n    </colgroup>\n    <thead>\n    <tr class=\"header\">\n    <th>If you want to:</th>\n    <th>Do this:</th>\n    </tr>\n    </thead>\n    <tbody>\n    <tr class=\"odd\">\n    <td>Create a new virtual network in Azure for the environment</td>\n    <td><ol>\n    <li>Click <strong><span class=\"label\">New virtual network</span></strong>.</li>\n    <li>Enter a name for the virtual network.</li>\n    </ol></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr class=\"even\">\n    <td>Add the environment to an existing virtual network in Azure</td>\n    <td><ol>\n    <li>Click <strong><span class=\"label\">Existing virtual network</span></strong>.</li>\n    <li>Select the name of the existing virtual network that you want to use.</li>\n    <li>The <strong><span class=\"label\">Address space</span></strong> field will automatically display the appropriate value. Select the provided value.</li>\n    <li>The <span class=\"label\"><strong>Application subnet name</strong></span> field will display available options. If you are deploying to an AD that was previously deployed through Lifecycle Services, select the <strong><span class=\"label\">*APPNET*</span></strong> value.</li>\n    <li>The Active Directory subnet must be entered and match the Active Directory subnet IP/Range found in the Azure management portal for the AD you desire to target.\n    <ol>\n    <li>Log on to the <a href=\"https://manage.windowsazure.com/\">Azure management portal</a>.</li>\n    <li>In the navigation pane on the left, click <strong><span class=\"label\">Networks</span></strong>.</li>\n    <li>Click the name of the virtual network that you’re going to use.</li>\n    <li>Click <strong><span class=\"label\">Configure</span></strong>. Details about the virtual network are listed on the page.</li>\n    </ol></li>\n    </ol></td>\n    </tr>\n    </tbody>\n    </table>\n\n11. Click **Done**. The **Deploy** **environment** panel is redisplayed.\n12. The number and size of each virtual machine that will be deployed is listed. Change the number and size of the virtual machines, as needed.\n    -   For information about the software installed on each virtual machine in this environment, see [Plan your Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3 deployment on Azure](plan-2012-r3-deployment-azure.md).\n    -   For sizing and pricing details about virtual machines, see [Virtual machines pricing details](http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/virtual-machines/).\n\n13. Click **Software License Terms** to review the licensing terms and conditions. Then select the check box to indicate that you agree to the terms.\n14. Click **Next**.\n15. Click **Deploy** to confirm that you’re ready to deploy the environment. The deployment may take a few hours to complete. When the deployment is done, the **Deployment Status** column on the **Cloud-hosted environments** page will display **Deployed**. (You may need to refresh your browser to see this.)If the deployment fails, you may see an error message right away. If the error occurs later in the deployment process, error details will be displayed in the details pane on the right-side of the page.\n\n## 5.

Enable users to access Dynamics AX 2012 R3 on Azure\nThe following sections provide information about how to configure the Azure virtual network and domain so that your corporate users can access Dynamics AX 2012 R3.\n\n### Create a site-to-site VPN connection\n\nTo enable corporate users to access resources on the virtual machines in the Azure virtual network, you’ll need to create a site-to-site VPN connection between the Azure virtual network and your on-premises, corporate network. For information about how to do this, see:\n\n-   [Virtual network overview](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windowsazure/jj156007.aspx)\n-   [Virtual network configuration tasks](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj156206.aspx)\n-   [Site-to-site VPN in Azure virtual network using Windows Server 2012 Routing and Remote Access Service (RRAS)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dn636917.aspx)\n-   [Configure a virtual network gateway in the management portal](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/jj156210.aspx)\n\n### Create a domain trust\n\nTo enable corporate users to access resources on the virtual machines in your Azure domain, you must create an Active Directory trust between the domains. For information about how to create a trust, see [Create a Forest Trust](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc754626.aspx). This process is the same process you would use to create a trust between two on-premises domains.\n\n### Give users access\n\nTo enable your users to access Dynamics AX , complete the following tasks:\n\n-   Add each user’s domain account to the Remote Desktop Users group on the CLI-&lt;GUID&gt; virtual machine.\n-   Give users access to Dynamics AX. For instructions, see [Create new users in Microsoft Dynamics AX](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa548139.aspx).\n\n**Note:** If you don’t want to create a VPN connection and a domain trust, you can still give users access to Dynamics AX. To do so, you’ll need to log on to the virtual machine that serves as the domain controller, and create domain accounts for each user. Then, you’ll need to complete the two tasks mentioned above.\n\n## 7. Learn more about the service accounts for this environment\nThe following sections provide information about the service accounts that were created when you deployed the environment.\n\n### Domain accounts\n\nThe following table lists the default names of the domain accounts that were created when you deployed the environment.\n\n| Domain account                  | Description                                                                                                           |\n|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| <DomainName>AOSServiceUser      | The account used to run the following services: Microsoft Dynamics AX Object Server                                   |\n| <DomainName>SQLServiceUser      | The account used to run the following services: SQL Server Analysis Services (MSSQLSERVER)                            |\n| <DomainName>DynamicsInstallUser | The account used to install Dynamics AX.                                                                              |\n| <DomainName>RetailServiceUser   | The account used to run the following services: Microsoft Dynamics AX for Retail Commerce Data Exchange Async Client. |\n| <DomainName>BCProxyUser         | The account used as the Business Connector proxy.                                                                     |\n\n**Note: **The passwords are displayed on the Cloud-hosted environments page in [Lifecycle Services](https://lifecycleservices.dynamics.com/en/).\n\n### Local administrator accounts\n\nEach virtual machine that you deployed has a local administrator account. This account is: builtinaxlocaladmin. The passwords for the local administrator accounts are displayed on the Cloud-hosted environments page in [Lifecycle Services](https://lifecycleservices.dynamics.com/en/).\n\n\n\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,814],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"# required metadata\n\ntitle: Deploy a Retail essentials dev/test environment on Azure (AX 2012)\ndescription: This article explains how to deploy a Retail essentials dev/test environment on Microsoft Azure.
