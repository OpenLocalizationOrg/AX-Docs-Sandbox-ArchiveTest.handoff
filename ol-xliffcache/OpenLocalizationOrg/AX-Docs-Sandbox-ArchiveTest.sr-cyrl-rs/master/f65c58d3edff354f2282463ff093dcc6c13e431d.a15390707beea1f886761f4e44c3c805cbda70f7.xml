If workflow is a key component of your organization, you should consider configuring the **Workflow message processing** batch job as critical.\n\nConfiguring the **Workflow message processing** batch job as critical ensures that the system actively tracks its status. When a critical batch job fails, the support team can better monitor failures and take action to resolve any issues that may have caused the failure.\n\nFollow these steps to configure the **Workflow message processing** batch job as critical.\n\n1. Navigate to the **Batch jobs** page.\n2. Search for **Workflow message processing** using the quick filter.\n3. Select the **Workflow message processing** batch job.\n4.
