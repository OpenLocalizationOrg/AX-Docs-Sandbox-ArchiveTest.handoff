The interest and fine amounts that apply to a payment can be calculated when you receive a payment from a customer. Before you calculate interest or fine codes for customer payments, you must set up a list of bank holidays and national holidays. A holiday date that is set up on the Payment calendar page is considered a non-working day. If an invoice is due on a non-working day, the due date is moved to the next working day in the calendar, and the interest and fines are calculated accordingly. This task uses the BRMF demo company.\n\n\n\n1. Go to Accounts receivable > Customers > All customers.\n2. In the list, find and select the desired record.\n3.
