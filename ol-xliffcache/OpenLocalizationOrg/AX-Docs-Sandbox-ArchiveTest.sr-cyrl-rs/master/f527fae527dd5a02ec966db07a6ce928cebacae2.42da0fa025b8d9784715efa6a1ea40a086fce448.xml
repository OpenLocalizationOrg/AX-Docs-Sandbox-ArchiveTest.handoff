In metadata, the form caption is represented by a property on the form design. Therefore, to change the caption, you must modify the **Caption** property on the form design. You can make this change through extension. Create an extension of the selected form in the extension model, and then change the **Caption** property as usual.\n\n![Modify the Caption property](media/ChangeCaption01.jpg)\n\nThe following illustration shows what the form caption looks like in a browser.\n\n![Form caption in a browser](media/ChangeCaption02.jpg)\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> None of the other properties on the form design can be changed.\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,659],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"\n# required metadata\n\ntitle: Change the caption of a form\ndescription: This topic explains how to change the form caption that helps the user identify the current page in a web browser.\nauthor: ivanv-microsoft\nmanager: AnnBe\nms.date: 07/10/2017\nms.topic: article\nms.prod: \nms.service: dynamics-ax-platform\nms.technology: \n\n\n# optional metadata\n\n# ms.search.form: \n# ROBOTS: \naudience: Developer\n# ms.devlang: \nms.reviewer: robinr\nms.search.scope: Operations, Platform\n# ms.tgt_pltfrm: \nms.custom: 268724\nms.assetid: \nms.search.region: Global\n# ms.search.industry: \nms.author: ivanv\nms.search.validFrom: 2017-02-28\nms.dyn365.ops.version: Platform update 4\n","nodes":[{"content":"Change the caption of a form","nodes":[{"pos":[0,28],"content":"Change the caption of a form","nodes":[{"content":"Change the caption of a form","pos":[0,28]}]}],"path":["title"],"extradata":"MT"},{"content":"This topic explains how to change the form caption that helps the user identify the current page in a web browser.","nodes":[{"pos":[0,114],"content":"This topic explains how to change the form caption that helps the user identify the current page in a web browser.","nodes":[{"content":"This topic explains how to change the form caption that helps the user identify the current page in a web browser.","pos":[0,114]}]}],"path":["description"],"extradata":"MT"}],"yml":true},{"pos":[667,695],"content":"Change the caption on a form","linkify":"Change the caption on a form","nodes":[{"content":"Change the caption on a form","pos":[0,28]}]},{"content":"The form caption appears in the page tab next to the web browser's Address bar and helps the user identify the page that is currently open.","pos":[697,836]},{"content":"In metadata, the form caption is represented by a property on the form design.","pos":[837,915]},{"content":"Therefore, to change the caption, you must modify the <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Caption<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> property on the form design.","pos":[916,1010],"source":" Therefore, to change the caption, you must modify the **Caption** property on the form design."},{"content":"You can make this change through extension.","pos":[1011,1054]},{"content":"Create an extension of the selected form in the extension model, and then change the <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Caption<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> property as usual.","pos":[1055,1170],"source":" Create an extension of the selected form in the extension model, and then change the **Caption** property as usual."},{"content":"Modify the Caption property","pos":[1174,1201]},{"content":"The following illustration shows what the form caption looks like in a browser.","pos":[1231,1310]},{"content":"Form caption in a browser","pos":[1314,1339]},{"pos":[1371,1444],"content":"[!NOTE]\nNone of the other properties on the form design can be changed.","leadings":["","> "],"nodes":[{"content":"None of the other properties on the form design can be changed.","pos":[8,71]}]}]}
