This may include transactional data presented in a tabular layout and advanced graphical views of aggregate information. To account for this broad definition, Finance and Operations offers several tools to produce reports to satisfy complex business requirements. One of these tools is SQL Server Reporting Services. SSRS reports provide the following advantages:\n\n-   Back office document management capabilities including email support, scheduled executions via batches, and print archive functionality.\n-   Parameterized views with drill-through navigation to Finance and Operations pages and other reports.\n-   Used to produce precision documents for compliance with local regulatory business practices\n\nFor more information, see [Create next-generation reporting solutions](create-nextgen-reporting-solutions.md).\n\n## To view the report\nThe [SQL Server Reporting Services Reports report](https://mbs.microsoft.com/customersource/northamerica/AX/downloads/reports/axtechrefrep)lists each report that is available. The report indicates the data set used for the each report, as well as the filters and fields available on each report.\n\n## How the report is grouped\nThe report is a Microsoft Excel file. In this report, the rows are grouped alphabetically on tab 1. All rows are displayed when you click tab 2. \n\n[![GeneratedReports](./media/generatedreports.png)](./media/generatedreports.png)\n\n\n\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,756],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"# required metadata\n\ntitle: SQL Server Reporting Services reports\ndescription: This topic points you to a report that lists the SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) reports available in Finance and Operations.\nauthor: sericks007\nmanager: AnnBe\nms.date: 06/20/2017\nms.topic: article\nms.prod: \nms.service: dynamics-ax-platform\nms.technology: \n\n# optional metadata\n\n# ms.search.form: \n# ROBOTS: \naudience: Developer, IT Pro\n# ms.devlang: \nms.reviewer: sericks\nms.search.scope: Operations, Platform, UnifiedOperations, AX Platform\n# ms.tgt_pltfrm: \nms.custom: 203494\nms.assetid: 99d70045-cde7-45ec-9817-bb6465723286\nms.search.region: Global\n# ms.search.industry: \nms.author: sericks\nms.search.validFrom: 2016-05-31\nms.dyn365.ops.version: Platform update 1\n","nodes":[{"content":"SQL Server Reporting Services reports","nodes":[{"pos":[0,37],"content":"SQL Server Reporting Services reports","nodes":[{"content":"SQL Server Reporting Services reports","pos":[0,37]}]}],"path":["title"],"extradata":"MT"},{"content":"This topic points you to a report that lists the SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) reports available in Finance and Operations.","nodes":[{"pos":[0,130],"content":"This topic points you to a report that lists the SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) reports available in Finance and Operations.","nodes":[{"content":"This topic points you to a report that lists the SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) reports available in Finance and Operations.","pos":[0,130]}]}],"path":["description"],"extradata":"MT"}],"header":"# required metadata\n","yml":true},{"pos":[764,801],"content":"SQL Server Reporting Services reports","linkify":"SQL Server Reporting Services reports","nodes":[{"content":"SQL Server Reporting Services reports","pos":[0,37]}]},{"content":"This topic points you to a report that lists the SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) reports available in Finance and Operations.","pos":[847,977]},{"content":"Reports can be defined simply as any visualization of a structured data set.","pos":[979,1055]},{"content":"This may include transactional data presented in a tabular layout and advanced graphical views of aggregate information.","pos":[1056,1176]},{"content":"To account for this broad definition, Finance and Operations offers several tools to produce reports to satisfy complex business requirements.","pos":[1177,1319]},{"content":"One of these tools is SQL Server Reporting Services.","pos":[1320,1372]},{"content":"SSRS reports provide the following advantages:","pos":[1373,1419]},{"content":"Back office document management capabilities including email support, scheduled executions via batches, and print archive functionality.","pos":[1425,1561]},{"content":"Parameterized views with drill-through navigation to Finance and Operations pages and other reports.","pos":[1566,1666]},{"content":"Used to produce precision documents for compliance with local regulatory business practices","pos":[1671,1762]},{"pos":[1764,1874],"content":"For more information, see <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Create next-generation reporting solutions<ept id=\"p1\">](create-nextgen-reporting-solutions.md)</ept>.","source":"For more information, see [Create next-generation reporting solutions](create-nextgen-reporting-solutions.md)."},{"pos":[1879,1897],"content":"To view the report","linkify":"To view the report","nodes":[{"content":"To view the report","pos":[0,18]}]},{"content":"The <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>SQL Server Reporting Services Reports report<ept id=\"p1\">](https://mbs.microsoft.com/customersource/northamerica/AX/downloads/reports/axtechrefrep)</ept>lists each report that is available.","pos":[1898,2073],"source":"The [SQL Server Reporting Services Reports report](https://mbs.microsoft.com/customersource/northamerica/AX/downloads/reports/axtechrefrep)lists each report that is available."},{"content":"The report indicates the data set used for the each report, as well as the filters and fields available on each report.","pos":[2074,2193]},{"pos":[2198,2223],"content":"How the report is grouped","linkify":"How the report is grouped","nodes":[{"content":"How the report is grouped","pos":[0,25]}]},{"content":"The report is a Microsoft Excel file.","pos":[2224,2261]},{"content":"In this report, the rows are grouped alphabetically on tab 1.","pos":[2262,2323]},{"content":"All rows are displayed when you click tab 2.","pos":[2324,2368]},{"pos":[2371,2452],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt><ph id=\"ph1\">![</ph>GeneratedReports<ept id=\"p1\">](./media/generatedreports.png)](./media/generatedreports.png)</ept>","source":"[![GeneratedReports](./media/generatedreports.png)](./media/generatedreports.png)"}]}
