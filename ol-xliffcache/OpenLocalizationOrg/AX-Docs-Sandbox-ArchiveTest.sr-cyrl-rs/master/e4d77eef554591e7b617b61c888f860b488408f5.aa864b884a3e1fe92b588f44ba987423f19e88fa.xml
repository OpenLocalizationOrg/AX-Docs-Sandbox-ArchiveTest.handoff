The GST-05 report includes breakdown details such as standard-rated, zero-rated, and exempt purchases and sales in a regulated format. To accommodate the requirements, you must complete the following two operations while you complete the tax settlement process:\n\n-   Categorize your tax codes into three categories by selecting proper value for the **VAT type** field on the **Sales tax codes** page:\n    -   Standard\n    -   Zero\n    -   Exempt\n-   On the sales tax authority page, specify the dedicated **Singapore report layout** reporting format.\n\nWhen you settle and post sales tax to process a tax settlement, the GST-05 report will be generated and printed.\n\n\n\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,851],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"# required metadata\n\ntitle: Generate the Singapore GST-05 report\ndescription: This article explains the functionality for generating Singapore GST-05 reports in Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, Enterprise edition.
