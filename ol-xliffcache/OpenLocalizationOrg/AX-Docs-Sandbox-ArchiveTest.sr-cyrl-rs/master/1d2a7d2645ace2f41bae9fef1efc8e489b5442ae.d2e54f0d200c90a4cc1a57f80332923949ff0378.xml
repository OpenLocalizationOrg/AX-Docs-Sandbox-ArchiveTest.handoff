Hardware Station can be extended either by implementing a new controller for a new device (for example, a cash dispenser) or by overriding an existing controller for an existing device type (for example, a new Audio Jack magnetic stripe reader (MSR) implementation).\n\n[![Hardware Station Architecture](./media/hardware-station-architecture-1024x764.png)](./media/hardware-station-architecture.png)\n\n## Retail Hardware Station extensibility scenarios\nExtensibility in Hardware Station is achieved by using [Managed Extensibility Framework (MEF)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd460648(v=vs.110).aspx), which is supported by .NET. **Extensibility guideline:** Always write your extension in your own extension assembly. That way, you're writing a true extension, and upgrades will be much easier. There are two basic scenarios for extension:\n\n-   **Adding a new device** – The out-of-box Hardware Station doesn't already support the device (for example, a cash dispenser). Therefore, you must add support for the new device in Hardware Station.\n-   **Adding a new device type for an existing device** – The out-of-box Hardware Station implementation already supports the device (for example, an MSR), but you must add support for a specific device type (for example, an Audio Jack MSR implementation).\n\n### Scenario 1: Adding a new device\n\nFor this scenario, we will add support for a cash dispenser device in Hardware Station. In our example, we will create a fake cash dispenser that dispenses cash in the Notepad file. However, this example will help you understand the end-to-end extensibility of Hardware Station.\n\n-   The Retail software development kit (SDK) has a cash dispenser sample. See RetailSdk\\\\SampleExtensions\\\\HardwareStation.\n-   In this case, we must add a new Web API controller and helper properties/methods.\n-   The new **CashDispender** controller must extend **ApiController** and **IHardwareStationController**.\n-   The **Export** attribute string here specifies the device that this controller is used for: \\[Export(\"CASHDISPENSER\", typeof(IHardwareStationController))\\]\n\n<!-- -->\n\n    namespace Contoso\n    {\n        namespace Commerce.HardwareStation.CashDispenserSample\n        {\n            using System;\n            using System.Composition;\n            using System.Web.Http;\n            using Microsoft.Dynamics.Commerce.HardwareStation;\n            using Microsoft.Dynamics.Retail.Diagnostics;\n            /// <summary>\n            /// Cash dispenser web API controller class.\n            /// </summary>\n            [Export(\"CASHDISPENSER\", typeof(IHardwareStationController))]\n            public class CashDispenserController : ApiController, IHardwareStationController\n            { \n                // Add your controller code here\n            }\n\n### Scenario 2: Adding a new device type for an existing device\n\nFor this scenario, we will add support for a new device type for an existing device (an Audio Jack MSR implementation).\n\n-   The **Export** attribute string specifies the device that this controller is used for: \\[Export(\"MSR\", typeof(IHardwareStationController))\\]\n-   Because there will be multiple controllers for MSRs, Hardware Station uses the configuration file to determine which implementation to use at run time. For more information, see the \"Retail Hardware Station extensibility configuration\" section later in this article.\n\n<!-- -->\n\n    namespace Contoso\n    {\n        namespace Commerce.HardwareStation.RamblerService\n        {\n            using System;\n            using System.Composition;\n            using System.Threading.Tasks;\n            using System.Web.Http;\n            using System.Web.Http.Controllers;\n            using Microsoft.Dynamics.Commerce.HardwareStation;\n            using Microsoft.Dynamics.Commerce.HardwareStation.DataEntity;\n            using Microsoft.Dynamics.Commerce.HardwareStation.Models;\n            using Microsoft.Dynamics.Retail.Diagnostics;\n            /// <summary>\n            /// MSR device web API controller class.\n            /// </summary>\n            [Export(\"MSR\", typeof(IHardwareStationController))]\n            [Authorize]\n            public class AudioJackMSRController : ApiController, IHardwareStationController\n            {\n                // Add controller implementation here\n            }\n\n## Retail Hardware Station extensibility configuration\n### Configuration for IIS-hosted Hardware Station\n\nBefore Hardware Station can consume your extension, the **composition** section in the Hardware Station Web.config file must be updated so that it includes an entry for your extension.
