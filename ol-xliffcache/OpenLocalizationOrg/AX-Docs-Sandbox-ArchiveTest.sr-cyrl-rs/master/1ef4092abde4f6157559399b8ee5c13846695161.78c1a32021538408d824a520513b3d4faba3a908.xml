The interest and fine amounts that apply to a payment can be calculated when you make a payment to a vendor. Before you calculate interest or fine codes for vendor payments, you must set up a list of bank holidays and national holidays. A holiday date that is set up on the Payment calendar page is considered a non-working day. If an invoice is due on a non-working day, the due date is moved to the next working day in the calendar, and the interest and fines are calculated accordingly.
