This version was released in July 2017 and has a build number of 7.2.11792.56024.\n\n**Note:** Dynamics 365 for Operations (on-premises) is currently being renamed. You will see Dynamics 365 for Operations (on-premises) referenced throughout communications and licensing guides. The in-product name that you will see when deploying the product is Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, Enterprise edition. Both of these names refer to the same product.\n\nGo to the [Dynamics 365 Roadmap](https://roadmap.dynamics.com/) to find supplemental information about new features and learn more about what new features are in development. \n\nIntroducing Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, Enterprise edition\n=======================================================================\n\nUsers and developers will see an updated product name (\"Microsoft Dynamics 365\nfor Finance and Operations, Enterprise edition\") and product icon in the web\nclient. Some platform components (for example, the developer tools and the\nmobile application) that are shared by Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations,\nDynamics 365 for Retail, and Dynamics 365 for Talent will now appear as\n\"Dynamics 365 Unified Operations.\"\n\n**Financial management**\n========================\n\nAccounts payable check templates using Electronic Reporting \n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTwo default check format templates are provided in Accounts payable. These check\ntemplates have been created using the Excel capabilities of the Electronic\nreporting tool. These checks templates are compatible with US check formats.\n\nFor more information, see [Electronic reporting sample check format](/dynamics365/unified-operations/financials/accounts-payable/electronic-reporting-sample-vendor-checks).\n\nBudget control data maintenance\n-------------------------------\n\nYou can reprocess documents against budget control. Documents are scanned\nagainst a list of potential issues, including any budget register entries that\nwere entered prior to budget control being enabled read-only audit trail is\npreserved for documents that are found, as well as the results of reprocessing.\n\nBudgeting Power BI for actual vs budget \n----------------------------------------\n\nThe Actual vs budget Power BI content provides visibility into your budget\nvariances based on your budget register. You can analyze budget for the current\nyear, using any of the following details to get a better understanding of any\nvariances:\n\n-   Account category\n\n-   Budget code\n\n-   Main account\n\n-   Main account description\n\n-   Fiscal period\n\nFor more information, see [Ledger Budget Power BI](/dynamics365/unified-operations/dev-itpro/analytics/ledger-budgets-power-bi).\n\nCFO Overview workspace\n----------------------\n\nThe CFO or accounting manager can view the full state of the business on the CFO\nOverview workspace. The workspace contains common KPIs and uses embedded\nanalytics to see financials, purchasing, sales, and cash flow data.\n\nFor more information, see [CFO overview Power BI content](/dynamics365/unified-operations/dev-itpro/analytics/CFO-power-bi).\n\nData validation\n---------------\n\nThe **Data validation checklist** workspace lets you track data validation\nprocesses across companies, areas, and people. The checklist can be used during\na new implementation, after an upgrade, or after a migration. Depending on your\nview of the **Data validation checklist** workspace, you'll see either all tasks\nand statuses for a data validation project.\n\nFor more information, see [Data validation workspace](/dynamics365/unified-operations/dev-itpro/user-interface/data-validation-workspace).\n\nDelete a main account and dimension value\n-----------------------------------------\n\nAs companies go live they often have main accounts or dimension values that they\nhave determined they no longer need. This feature lets you remove the main\naccount and dimension values if there are no posted transaction, keeping the\npristine golden template intact.\n\nFor more information, see [Financial dimensions](/dynamics365/unified-operations/financials/general-ledger/financial-dimensions).\n\nDisplay payment information for an expense\n------------------------------------------\n\nThis provides visibility into payment information for an expense, such as the\nrelated invoice number, payment date, and payment voucher.\n\nEdit account entries in the allocation journal\n----------------------------------------------\n\nYou can now edit the account entries in the allocation journal before posting.\nThis means that you can make changes due to exceptions that occur periodically\nin the allocation process. This saves time having to regularly modify the\nallocation rule setup.\n\nExpense management mobile workspace\n-----------------------------------\n\nMany organizations require that a copy of a receipt be attached to a\ntravel-related or business-related report that an employee submits for\nreimbursement. The **Expense management** mobile workspace lets users quickly\ncreate new expense lines on the mobile device of their choice by using an\nattached photo of a receipt. Alternatively, users can capture a photo of a\nreceipt and then attach it to an expense report later. Employees also can create\nand manage their expense reports and submit for approval and reimbursement using\ntheir mobile device.\n\nSpecifically, the **Expense management** mobile workspace enables a user to:\n\n-   Take a photo of a receipt, and upload it to Microsoft Dynamics for Finance\n    and Operations, Enterprise edition. A user can then attach that photo to an\n    expense report later.\n\n-   Upload a file as a captured receipt. A user can then attach that file to an\n    expense report later.\n\n-   Create a new expense line by using an attached receipt. A user can then add\n    the line item to an expense report later, and submit it for approval and\n    reimbursement.\n\n-   Create a new expense report.\n\n-   Attach credit card transactions and other previously created expenses to an\n    expense report.\n\n-   Create new expenses for an expense report.\n\n-   Attach a receipt to any expense for an expense report by either taking a\n    photo of the receipt or uploading a file as a captured receipt.\n\n-   Add the list of guests to an expense based on expense policy.\n\n-   Itemize expenses based on expense policy.\n\n-   Submit an expense report for approval and reimbursement.\n\n-   Approve or reject expense reports assigned to the employee as an approver.\n\nFor more information, see [Expense management mobile workspace](/dynamics365/unified-operations/financials/expense-management/expense-management-mobile-workspace).\n\nExpense management: Configuration related to employee's card ID\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn prior releases, the employee’s expense credit card ID was designed to only\nallow up to 10 characters and displayed the last 4 digits entered as the card\nID. The ability to enter more characters was required for organizations that\nhave an agreement with their credit card company to use another key to identify\nan employee’s credit card number without entering the credit card number. This\nkey is often greater than 10 characters and is typically between 20 and 30\ncharacters.\n\nThis feature has lengthened the **Card ID** field for the employee’s credit card\nsetup (**Human resources** \\> **Workers** \\> **Employees** \\> **Expense** tab \\>\n**Credit cards**) and provides a parameter to validate whether a 15- or\n16-character number is allowed as the card ID. The parameter, **Enter employee\ncredit card number**, is found on the **General** tab of the **Expense\nmanagement parameters** form (**Expense management** \\> **Setup** \\> **General**\n\\> **Expense management parameters**). By default, credit card numbers are not\nallowed as the expense credit card ID.\n\nExpense management: Configure per diem locations per country/region, state/province, and location\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis feature allows expense administrators to configure the per diem locations\nto be set up based on country/region, state/province, and location. This\nconfiguration can provide more granular setup of the per diem rates. To use this\nfeature, go to **Expense management** \\> **Setup** \\> **Calculations and codes**\n\\> **Per diem locations**.\n\nExpense management: Display related payment information for an expense report\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis feature provides visibility into related Accounts payable invoices that\nwere generated for an expense report and the related payment information.\nEmployees will have insight into the invoice number(s) and the payment voucher\nnumber for their expense reports to help them better understand the state of\ntheir reimbursement for travel expenses.\n\nA periodic process must be run before the invoice and payment related\ninformation can be displayed for an expense report (**Expense management** \\>\n**Periodic tasks** \\> **Update expense payment information**). The **Update\nexpense payment information** process can be set up as a recurring batch process\nand set to update depending on how often the organization reimburses for travel\nexpenses.\n\nIf viewing expense reports in the grid view, columns for **Payment date**,\n**Payment voucher**, and **Invoice** are displayed. If multiple invoices or\npayments were generated for a selected expense report, the column will display\n**\\<multiple\\>**. The information is also displayed in the **Payment details**\nform for the expense report by clicking the **Payments** button when viewing the\ndetails of the expense report.\n\nExpense management: Export and import expense policies using data management\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNew data entities are available that enable support of the export and import of\nexpense policies.\n\nThe following entities are available to help manage implementation of expense\npolicies:\n\n-   Policy type (SysPolicyTypeEntity)\n\n-   Policies (SysPolicyEntity)\n\n-   Policy rule type (SysPolicyRuleTypeEntity)\n\n-   Policy organization (SysPolicyOrganizationEntity)\n\n-   Policy organization assignments\n    (SysPolicyInternalOrganizationAssignmentEntity)\n\n-   Expense and travel policy rule (TrvPolicyRuleEntity)\n\n-   Expense policy translations (TrvPolicyLanguageTxtEntity)\n\nExpense management: Final approver defaulted for multi-level workflow approval\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhen expense management workflow is configured to use the multi-approval\nworkflow, the default for the final approver will be based on the employee's\nmanager. Prior to this release, the default final approver was empty and the\nemployee had to enter the final approver and optionally set it as the default.\nThis workflow can be configured for organizations where expense reports must go\nthrough a multi-approver process, such as having the project manager approve\nproject related expenses or having a team administrator approve expenses prior\nto the employee's manager.\n\nExpense management: Match credit card expenses with manually entered expenses\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEmployees may need to submit timely expense reports ahead of credit card\nexpenses that are being imported into the system, depending on company policy or\nagreements with their clients for billing purposes. When the credit card expense\nis not yet available for an expense report, employees can create the expense for\nthe expense report and submit for approval and reimbursement. Later, the credit\ncard transaction comes in and the employee is unable to remove it from the list\nof expenses that they need to deal with.\n\nThis feature provides support to match a credit card transaction to an existing,\nmanually created expense from the **Expenses** form (**Expense management** \\>\n**My expenses** \\> **Expenses**) or from the **Expense report** form (**Expense\nmanagement** \\> **My expenses** \\> **Expense reports**). If the manual expense\nhas not yet been included in an expense report submitted for approval, the\nmanual expense line and the credit card transaction will be merged with the\ncredit card transaction as the master for information such as transaction date,\nmerchant, and transaction amount. Any attached receipts, guests, or itemizations\nthat may have been added to the manual expense line will be added to the credit\ncard expense and the manual expense will be deleted.\n\nIf the manual expense has been submitted with an expense report for approval,\nmatching the manual expense with the credit card transaction will remove the\ncredit card transaction from the list of expenses for the employee. The employee\ncan remove the match when viewing their matched expenses from the **Matched\nexpenses** form (**Expense management** \\> **My expenses** \\> **Matched\nexpenses**).\n\nExpense management: Split credit card expenses\n----------------------------------------------\n\nThere are times when a credit card transaction expense needs to be split across\nmultiple project activities or expense categories, for example, while keeping\nthe credit card transaction intact for credit card statement reconciliation\npurposes. This feature provides support for an employee to split a credit card\nexpense across:\n\n-   Legal entities\n\n-   Expense categories\n\n-   Projects\n\n-   Project activities\n\n-   Billable/nonbillable (Project line property)\n\nTo use this feature, go to **Expense management** \\> **My expenses** \\>\n**Expense reports** or **Expense management** \\> **My expenses** \\>\n**Expenses**.\n\nWhen viewing the expenses in the details view or the grid view for a credit card\nexpense, click the **Split** button to open a form that will allow the employee\nto split the expense. The split expenses will be displayed for the credit card\nexpense in the list of expenses when in the details view. A visual indicator\nwill be displayed for credit card expenses that have been split in the grid\nview.\n\nExpense management: Support for importing credit card itemization data\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMany organizations have expense policies requiring certain expenses, such as\nhotel, car rental, and airline expenses, to have itemization details entered\nbefore submitting the expense for approval. Organizations can work with their\ncredit card company to receive files that contain itemization details for\nimport. This feature provides the ability for expense administrators to set up\nmapping codes for the expense itemization subcategories and the ability to\nimport the itemization details using data management.\n\nA new form is provided to configure the mapping of the itemization subcategories\nto the credit card codes provided by the credit card company. To import the file\nprovided by the credit card company, the system administrator can import the\nfile using data management by selecting to import into the **Credit card\nitemizations** entity (TrvPBSItemizationsEntity).\n\nTo use this feature, go to **Expense management \\> Setup \\> Calculations and\ncodes \\> Subcategory codes**.\n\nExpense management: Usability enhancements\n------------------------------------------\n\nMultiple features have been added to improve the usability of creating and\nmanaging expense reports. Enhancements include:\n\n-   A new **Expense management** workspace to simplify the navigation for\n    creating and managing expense reports.\n\n-   Ability for an employee to view their list of expense reports in a grid\n    view.\n\n-   Providing visibility to the employee that a receipt is required for an\n    expense when the expense is saved or modified, depending on company\n    policies. A visual indicator is displayed for the expense if viewing\n    expenses in detail. If expenses are displayed in grid view, columns for\n    **Receipt required** and **Receipt attached** are displayed.\n\n-   The details view will be displayed as the default with a view. Receipts,\n    guests, itemizations, and financial dimensions will be displayed next to the\n    expense details in the same view. The employee will be able to easily find\n    how to enter this information for a selected expense.\n\n-   Enhanced visibility into expenses with policy violations by providing a\n    visual indicator with the expense. The visual indicator will include hover\n    text that displays the message provided by the expense policy.\n\n-   Simplified entry of itemizations for an expense including the ability to\n    copy itemizations from one day to the next.\n\nExpense management: View detailed workflow history for an expense report\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe workflow history for an expense report can be complicated depending on how\nmany levels of approval your organization has or if the expense report has come\nback to the submitter multiple times for various reasons. This feature will\nprovide a more user-friendly way to view the workflow history for an expense\nreport. Clicking the **View history** button opens the **View history** form and\ndisplays the workflow history, including any comments provided at each workflow\nstep.\n\nFinancial dimensions in Financial reporting report definition\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\nYou can select what financial dimensions are relevant for a report in the\nFinancial reporting report definition. For example, if you’re generating a\nbalance sheet, and the organization only wants to evaluate it by main account\nand business unit, you can select those as the financial dimensions for the\nreport. You will only see those in the drill down and analysis. This helps\npersonalize and make the reporting experience more streamlined, only presenting\nthe information that is necessary for a report.\n\nFinancial dimensions in Power BI\n--------------------------------\n\nThe financial dimensions in the Financial performance content pack are now\navailable for analyzing financial data. For more information, see [Financial\nperformance power BI](/dynamics365/unified-operations/dev-itpro/analytics/financial-performance-power-bi-content-pack).\n\nFinancial report generation\n---------------------------\n\nYou can generate financial reports from the Financial reports list page and\nselect the date and units of the reporting hierarchy. This saves time because\nyou no longer need to view a prior version of the report. You can open the\nReport designer, and only view the units of the reporting hierarchy that are\nrelevant.\n\nMaintain carry-forward status\n-----------------------------\n\nThis feature provides an alternate way to report on carry-forward budget. This\nmaintains the carry-forward status on relieving documents, which are based on an\noriginating document that was carry-forward.\n\nMap credit card data (itemization details)\n------------------------------------------\n\nThis feature allows you to map level 3 credit card data (itemizations) to\nsubcategories, which makes it easy to import itemization details received from\nyour credit card company.\n\nMobile invoice approvals\n------------------------\n\nNew mobile capabilities allow you to review and approve vendor invoices that\nhave been submitted through workflow using a mobile device.\n\nFor more information, see [Mobile invoice approvals](/dynamics365/unified-operations/financials/accounts-payable/mobile-invoice-approvals).\n\nConfiguration data packages\n----------------------------\n\nConfiguration data packages are available as process data packages from Lifecycle Services (LCS) for core Financial modules. These data packages can help improve the repeatability of implementations and accelerate the configuration of Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, Enterprise edition.\n\nThe data packages contain configuration entity spreadsheets. These entity spreadsheets have best practice data, which you can use to create an initial ‘golden’ build. The data entities in the data packages are also sequenced appropriately, to help ensure a successful single-click import of the data. For more information, see [Configuration data packages](/dynamics365/unified-operations/dev-itpro/data-entities/configuration-data-packages). \n\n\nSave Financial reports to SharePoint\n------------------------------------\n\nThe standard functionality for sending reports to SharePoint is now available for reports generated through Financial reporting. When choosing to export or print a generated financial statement, you can now select to publish the financial report to SharePoint.  Using the standard functionality, you can define a notification when a report is available.\n\nSuspended and inactive dimension values hidden from dimension value lookups\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhen a company decides to no longer use a specific dimension value, the value is\nhidden from the dimension value lookups. This makes the user experience\nconsistent with the segmented entry control, and prevents re-active steps when\nvalidation messages are experienced during posting.\n\nYou will see the date that used to determine whether the financial dimension\nvalue is active. If you want to see all possible financial dimension values,\nclick **Show all**.\n\nTravel requisition functionality (Dynamics AX 2012 parity)\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis feature enables the travel requisition functionality in parity with\nDynamics AX 2012. Employees can create and submit travel requisitions for\napproval and reconcile them with expense reports. Your organization may require\nthat a travel requisition be submitted before an employee incurs an expense that\nis charged to the organization. This applies whether the employee is charging\nexpenses to a corporate credit card, spending cash received from a cash advance,\nor incurring out-of-pocket expenses that will be reimbursed by the organization.\n\nTravel requisitions and policies can be used to help with budget control. For\nexample, if your organization is working on a fixed-price project that requires\ntravel, the travel expenses of the project team members must fit within the\nbudget of the project. Requiring that travel expenses be approved before they\nare incurred can help to ensure that the project stays within budget.\n\nVendor invoice attachment enhancements\n--------------------------------------\n\nAs organizations look to streamline their Accounts payable processes, invoice\nprocessing is often one of the top process areas that needs efficiency.\nOftentimes, organizations offload the paper invoice processing to a third-party\noptical character recognition (OCR) service provider to get machine readable\ninvoice metadata along with the scanned image of the invoice. To help with\nautomation, a solution is built in the invoicing system to enable consumption of\nthese artifacts. Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, Enterprise edition\nenables this automation out of the box. \n\nThe basic premise of invoice automation is to enable a standard interface that\ncan accept invoice metadata for invoice header and invoice lines, as well as the\nattachments that are applicable to the invoice. Any external system that can\ngenerate the artifacts and comply with the interface will be able to send the\nfeed to Finance and Operations for automatic processing of invoices and\nattachments. \n\nThe following components make up the solution footprint of vendor invoice\nautomation. \n\n-   Data entities for invoice header, invoice lines, and invoice attachments. \n\n-   Exception processing for invoices. This is a business user-friendly UI to\n    manage invoices that failed to get created.\n\n-   A side-by-side attachment viewer in invoices in exception handling forms,\n    pending invoices, and invoice journal inquiries.\n\nFor more information, see [Vendor invoice automation](/dynamics365/unified-operations/financials/accounts-payable/vendor-invoice-automation).\n\nView detailed workflow history for an expense report \n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nThe workflow history for an expense report can be complicated depending on how\nmany levels of approval your organization has or if the expense report has come\nback to the submitter multiple times for various reasons. This feature provides\na more user-friendly way to view the workflow history for an expense report.\n\n**Financial management \\| Supply chain management**\n===================================================\n\nCost accounting – Cross legal entities \n---------------------------------------\n\nTo provide in-depth managerial insights, Cost accounting needs to be able to\ncross the boundaries of legal entities because all or some of these legal\nentities serve the purpose of statutory reporting. This is easy if all legal\nentities are in the same version of the product. This feature resolves the more\nchallenging problem, where legal entities are running on different versions or\ninstances of the same version, by connecting the data from instances in Dynamics\nAX 2012 R3 CU11 or later to Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, Enterprise\nedition.\n\nCost accounting allocation bases\n--------------------------------\n\nThe allocation base feature has been extended so Cost accountants can create an\nallocation base that matches their requirement.\n\nThe following allocation base types have been introduced:\n\n-   **Predefined dimension member allocation base** - All cost element dimension\n    members and statistical dimension members are, by default, created as\n    predefined dimension member allocation bases.\n\n-   **Formula allocation base** - A formula can include one or more allocation\n    bases of any type and can include user-defined constants. The following\n    operators are supported: + , - , \\* , = , \\< , \\> , ( , )\n\n-   **Hierarchy allocation bases** - Combine an allocation base of any type with\n    a cost object dimension hierarchy node to limit the range.\n\nCost accounting dimension hierarchies \n--------------------------------------\n\nCost accounting dimension hierarchies provide a way for you to move a hierarchy\nnode to a new parent node in the hierarchy or perform a simple re-order of nodes\nwithin a parent node by using the **Move up** or **Move down** buttons. This\nsignificantly reduces amount of the time spent maintaining dimension\nhierarchies.\n\nCost accounting Get started wizard\n----------------------------------\n\nThe Get started wizard provides an easy way to get started with Cost accounting.\nBasic master data and reference data is automatically generated based on how you\nanswer a few simple questions in the wizard.\n\nTransactional data is also processed, which allows you to populate the Cost\ncontrol workspace with your own data.\n\nThe wizard provides a good foundation for further exploring the capabilities of\nCost accounting.\n\nCost accounting ledger administration workspace\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nThe Cost accounting ledger administration workspace provides Cost accountants\nwith an overview of the status of individual cost accounting ledgers. All\nfunctions required for the administration of a cost accounting ledger can easily\nbe accessed directly from this workspace.\n\nThe health of the cost accounting ledger and its related master data and\nreference data are monitored, such as cost objects dimensions, dimension\nhierarchies, and rules. This makes it easy to manage cost accounting ledgers.\n\n**Globalization & translation**\n===============================\n\nBelgian Enterprise number Registration ID is used for customer and vendor accounts\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe enterprise number is a unique identification code assigned by the Belgian\ngovernment to each Belgian company to replace the nine-digit VAT number. For\nexample, the enterprise number can be assigned to vendor accounts and customer\naccounts. The enterprise number is used for regulatory reporting, to generate\nthe EU sales list, the Annual sales list, or to declare VAT.\n\nSetup of the enterprise number for vendor and customer accounts was aligned with\nhow setup was previously used for legal entities. Now it uses Registration IDs\nand enterprise number setup for reporting.\n\nEnhancements to the German audit file (GDPdU)\n---------------------------------------------\n\nThe following enhancements have been implemented to the GDPdU\\\\GoBD sample\nelectronic reporting configurations:\n\n-   Significantly improved performance with use of filter() function in\n    calculated fields.\n\n-   Primary registration numbers for customer and vendor accounts are now\n    exported instead of tax exempt numbers.\n\n-   Labels are used in configurations.\n\n-   Encoding of index.xml file is updated.\n\n-   DTD file attachment embedded in the format configuration.\n\nFor more information, see [German audit file\n(GDPdU/GoBD)](/dynamics365/unified-operations/financials/localizations/emea-deu-gdpdu-audit-data-export).\n\nGlobal coverage - Configurable Electronic Reporting\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nThe following features have been added to the Electronic Reporting (ER) engine.\n\n**Improved ER configurations management** – You can now designate, other than\napplication’s hotfixes, software components as prerequisites for an ER\nconfiguration. Each version of ER configuration can be marked as dependent on a\nspecific version (or range of versions) for the following software:\n\n-   Application\n\n-   Application model\n\n-   Application hotfix package\n\n-   ER configuration\n\nInformation about prerequisites is used to automatically recognize and import to\nyour instance of the application the only compatible ER configuration to ensure\nsmooth functioning. You can also check the compatibility of a selected ER\nconfiguration with your current environment. Doing this, you will be informed\nabout all prerequisites required to successfully run that ER configuration and\nmissing in the current application. That will allow you to install prerequisites\nin advance.\n\n**Management of ER model mappings independently from ER models** – You can now\nmanage your data models in ER model configurations that do not contain model\nmappings. This means that you can maintain your single data model as an abstract\ndefinition of a certain business domain independent from any application that\nprovides this model with actual data at run-time. In addition, you can manage\napplication-specific model mappings in ER model mapping configurations. The same\nER model can be used in different applications with different\napplication-specific ER model mapping configurations. With this approach, when\nyou have an ER model with multiple subordinated ER formats and need to migrate\nthem to another version of the application or even to a new application, you\nonly need to update the appropriate ER model mapping, if needed. This allows\ncustomers to significantly reduce the effort needed to complete such migration.\n\n**Improved Office-based reports** –  You are now able to configure ER reports\nfor generation of outputs in Office formats (Excel and Word) that contain images\nand shapes. This allows customers to easily satisfy specific requirements to\npresent images and shapes in generated documents (for example, in payment\nchecks) company logo, signatures, QR codes, etc.\n\n**Configurable update of application data** – You can now configure a single ER\nformat for generation of outgoing electronic documents and update of application\ndata based on information of outgoing documents within a single execution. This\nallows customers to configure (without coding) the following scenarios using ER\nframework:\n\n-   When a customer wants to mark application data right after its usage for\n    generation of electronic documents, to prevent repeated usage in subsequent\n    processes.\n\n-   When a customer wants to store the details of document processing that have\n    been generated by using ER logic, to consume these details later in\n    post-reporting processes.\n\n**ER configurations design improvement** – We improved the ER Operation designer\nso that a business person can design abstract data models and formats of\nbusiness documents using these models as data sources, without dependency on\ndata model mappings. An application specialist can design model mappings for\nthis data model in parallel and independently from a business person. The\ncompleted model mapping will be needed only at run-time. This empowers customers\nto quickly complete all necessary components of the entire ER solution.\n\n**Improved design of Excel-based reports** – We improved ER Operations designer\nto better support Excel-based reports. With just a few clicks, you can now\nsynchronize the structure of earlier designed and already available ER format\nwith the content of the updated Excel document that is used as a template for\ngenerating electronic documents. This allows customers to quickly adopt new\nrequirements for recipients waiting for generated by ER reports in Office\nformats.\n\n**Extended ER parameters** – We introduced a new parameter to configure the\nnumber of parallel threads for importing ER configurations from the Lifecycle\nServices (LCS) asset library. This allows customers to improve communications\nwith the LCS service and improve performance.\n\n**JSON format support** – You are now able to configure a single ER report for\ngeneration of output in JSON format. This allows customers to easily satisfy\nrequirements for specific recipients like web-based services.\n\n**New built-in functions** – We introduced several new functions that can be\nused in ER expressions. This enables customers to configure required business\nlogic: support necessary data types transformation to align incoming information\nwith structure of application data, generate QR codes to present them in\ngenerated documents as images, etc.\n\n**Electronic reporting features as configurations** - We continued moving\nelectronic reporting features of the application to ER framework, to simplify\nfurther customization of these features by our partners and customers and allow\nfor easy upgrade in case of regulatory changes. More than 170 features for 34\nreleased countries have been ported to ER configurations, including all payment\nformats to handle outgoing and incoming messages and all formats for electronic\ninvoices.\n\nGlobal coverage – Languages\n---------------------------\n\nThis feature allows ISVs and partners to create a new language in Dynamics 365\nfor Finance and Operations, Enterprise edition, including managing this process\nthroughout upgrades and updates of source labels via extensions.\n\nGlobal coverage - Retail \n-------------------------\n\nRegulatory Retail features for Sweden have been added to support local\nrequirements for cash registers, including general requirements to continuous\nuse of cash registers, as well as an example of integration of Dynamics 365 for\nRetail POS with a fiscal device (control unit).\n\nFor more information, see [Cash registers for\nSweden](/dynamics365/unified-operations/retail/localizations/emea-swe-cash-registers).\n\nReverse charge functionality for European countries/regions\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\nYou can configure reverse charge applicability rules per document type\n(purchase/sales order, vendor invoice, free text invoice, etc.) and a reverse\ncharge group that combines items, items groups, and purchase/sales categories.\nThe applicability rules are date effective. You can also mark individual sales\ntax codes in sales tax groups as applicable for reverse charge. The sales\ninvoice report is adjusted to represent details of the applied reverse charge.\nThe functionality has been made available to all European countries/regions.\n\nFor more information, see [Reverse\ncharges](/dynamics365/unified-operations/financials/localizations/emea-reverse-charge).\n\nSubstitution/adjustment invoices for Thailand\n---------------------------------------------\n\nThe Substitution/adjustment invoice feature has been implemented to track\nprinting of copies of invoices. When a copy of an invoice needs to be printed,\nit is required to specify the reason for the substitution. A special remark is\nprinted in the invoice copy that includes the reason of the substitution and the\nnumber of copies printed.\n\nIn addition, if the Adjustment option is used, it is also possible to adjust the\ncustomer information printed in the invoice, including the customer name,\naddress, contact information, tax registration number, and branch number and\nname. The Adjustment invoice gets a new invoice number and date, and references\nthe original invoice.\n\nTax invoices and tax reports for Thailand\n-----------------------------------------\n\nTax invoice and other tax report layouts have been adjusted to comply with local\nrequirements in Thailand. Sales invoices, free text invoices, debit/credit\nnotes, and project invoices can now be printed using the Thai tax invoice\nlayout. The Purchase/Sales VAT reports and the Withholding Tax Certificate\nreport have also been amended.\n\nSeveral enhancements have been implemented to the invoicing process. Tax\nregistration number and Branch number are now required in the Vendor master. It\nis not possible to post a vendor invoice with a date in the future or older than\n6 months. Return reason is required for sales credit/debit notes. Original\ninvoice reference and amount are copied to a sales credit/debit note.\n\n**Human resources**\n===================\n\nBenefits workspace \n-------------------\n\nBenefits workspace allows you to easily view and manage benefits offered to\nworkers in a central location. This workspace lets you:\n\n-   Gain insight into benefits not being used by employees.\n\n-   View which benefits are being phased out at the end of the year.\n\n-   Keep track of benefit costs and how costs may have changed in the past year.\n\nConfigurable business processes\n-------------------------------\n\nThe Configurable business process feature allows you to create a business\nprocess template for processes that need to be completed within your\norganization. For example, your company may have a HR audit that is performed\neach year. A template can be created to track all the tasks that need to be\ncompleted as part of the audit process. Templates can be re-used or copied for\nrecurring processes.\n\nAfter a template is created, you can start a process, and track it in the\n**Business process** workspace. When a business process is started, the tasks\nwill be assigned to the appropriate individuals with the appropriate due date.\n\nConfigurable business processes let you:\n\n-   Define templates for processes within your organization.\n\n-   Define calendars to apply to tasks for all processes.\n\n-   Define a process owner for each business process template.\n\n-   Analyze past due tasks and identify bottlenecks in the process.\n\n-   Provide instructions to all tasks.\n\n-   Assign checklists at any point in the process.\n\n-   Re-assign tasks and update due dates.\n\nDirect deposit\n--------------\n\nWithin ESS individuals can set up their direct deposit information, which lets\nemployees easily distribute their paycheck to multiple accounts.\n\nDirect deposit lets employees:\n\n-   Add multiple bank accounts.\n\n-   Set priority of bank disbursements.\n\n-   Direct any remaining funds to a specific account.\n\nEmployee and manager self-service \n----------------------------------\n\nEmployee self-service (ESS) and Manager self-service (MSS) pages offer a single\nlocation for employees to view and update their personal information, as well as\nview upcoming activities.

Cash flow analysis Power BI reports provide visibility into your\ncash flow and provide forecasts that allow you to make better decisions leading\nto healthy cash flows.\n\nYou can analyze your future cash inflow and outflows, both at a high-level\nsummary and at detailed levels. You can analyze cash inflows by legal entity,\nbank account, and currency to get a better understanding of surpluses and short\nfalls. Overall, you can get a temporal view of gaps and address them\nproactively.\n\nFor more information, see [Cash flow forecasting](/dynamics365/unified-operations/financials/cash-bank-management/cash-flow-forecasting).\n\nCost accounting Power BI reports\n--------------------------------\n\nCost accounting Power BI reports provide the ability to build rich\nvisualizations for C-level managers highlighting the performance of the entire\norganization in a common currency\n\nThese reports allow you to view performance at any organizational or individual\ncost object level, such as cost centers and product groups. You can validate\noverhead calculation and view the net change by cost object origin from cost\ncenter allocations with cost roll-up details.\n\nYou can also combine statistical elements and cost elements by cost objects.\n\nFor more information, see [Cost accounting analysis Power BI content](/dynamics365/unified-operations/dev-itpro/analytics/cost-accounting-analysis-content-pack).\n\nCredit and collections management Power BI\n------------------------------------------\n\nThe Credit and collections management Power BI content pack provides deep\ninsights into your credit management and collection process to help you\neffectively manage your credit and collections. This is an indispensable tool\nfor credit and collection managers, collections clerk, as well as account\nmanagers, in that it provides the information needed to make decisions backed by\ndata. Using key measures such as days sales outstanding (DSO) and customers over\ncredit limit, you can locate customers, customer groups, and regions that are\ncontributing to poor collections. You can take corrective action backed by data\nto avoid process delays and bottlenecks.\n\nYou can use this tool to provide rich insights to your account and sales\nmanagers on customers’ collection performance, to enable them to identify\nvaluable customers. You can encourage your customer-facing staff to seek\nvaluable partnerships backed by data, and encourage sales staff to promote\nproducts and services with the right combination of pricing and terms. Power BI\nreports help you to become a master of managing by exception. You can identify\ncustomers over or nearing their credit limits and understand the likelihood of\npayment delays and past due payments, so that you can intervene before it’s too\nlate. Reports can be used to detect payments and customer groups before they\nreach past due stage, so you will be able to understand probabilities of past\ndue payments and define alert conditions to notify you in case of exceptions.\nComprehensive reporting and dashboard capabilities built into Power BI mean that\nyour collections and account management teams can proactively manage their\ncustomers. \n\nFor more information, see [Credit and collections management Power BI content](/dynamics365/unified-operations/financials/accounts-receivable/credit-collections-power-bi).\n\nEmbedded Power BI reports licensed for all users\n------------------------------------------------\n\nIn the August 2016 update of Dynamics 365 for Operations (referred to as\nDynamics AX 7.0), users could pin full page Power BI reports to their\nworkspaces. With full page, interactive reports, you could explore data and\nperform what-if analysis over large volumes of data. Accessing and pinning Power\nBI reports required you to have a PowerBI.com subscription. As additional\nreports are delivered by Microsoft and our partner ecosystem, Power BI\ncapability is becoming a crucial reporting option for all users of your\norganization.\n\nAll user can now access Power BI reports based on Entity store, the operational\ndata warehouse that is included with Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations,\nEnterprise edition.\n\nNo Power BI licenses are required to access these reports, which are embedded in\nthe Finance and Operations application. If a user requires access to Power BI\nreports and functionality outside of this embedded experience, a Power BI\nlicense must be obtained separately. Features that were introduced to pin tiles\nand reports from PowerBI.com will continue to be supported.\n\nEmbedded Practice manager Power BI content\n------------------------------------------\n\nThe Practice manager Power BI content pack has been embedded into the Project\nmanagement workspace **Analytics** tab.\n\nThe Practice manager Power BI content pack is also available in the Shared\nassets library in Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services (LCS).\n\nThe Practice manager Power BI content was created for practice managers and\nproject managers. It provides key metrics that are related to the projects that\nthe organization is working on. The content gives an overview of the projects\nand related customers. The Power BI content pulls data from the project\naccounting aggregate measurements for Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and\nOperations, Enterprise edition.\n\nThe Practice manager Power BI content contains five report pages: one overview\npage and four pages that provide details about project costs, revenues, earned\nvalue management, and hour metrics that are split out across various dimensions.\nFor more information, see [Practice manager Power BI content](/dynamics365/unified-operations/dev-itpro/analytics/practice-manager-power-bi).\n\nFixed asset management workspace and embedded Power BI content \n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Fixed asset management workspace provides accountants quick access to their\nfixed asset data. It has information regarding asset acquisitions and disposals,\nas well as direct navigation to the depreciation proposal and fixed asset\njournal. The Find fixed assets section allows you to search for specific assets\nby number, group, name, location, or person responsible and easily view\nfinancial details about the assets and associated books.\n\nEmbedded Fixed asset management Power BI reports provide CFOs and Operations\nmanagement with deep insights into fixed assets, including acquisitions, book\nvalue, and depreciation.\n\nYou can view key asset book lifetime metrics, such as net book value (NBV),\ndepreciation, and accumulated depreciation by asset category and location. You\ncan dive into patterns and understand trends that lie hidden beneath the data,\nand make strategic decisions, such as major upgrades and plant re-tooling\nproactively, backed with data.\n\nFor more information, see [Fixed asset management workspace](/dynamics365/unified-operations/financials/fixed-assets/fixed-asset-management-workspace).\n\nPower BI reporting with financial dimensions \n---------------------------------------------\n\nFinancial dimensions are user defined “configuration” data that enables the\nledger chart of accounts to retain additional information. By adding financial\ndimensions, a user can configure additional data fields to be included with the\nchart of accounts as well as with Financial reports. This enables the ledger\nchart of accounts to be sliced and diced with those fields.\n\nThis is very powerful in Financial analysis and reporting because you will be\nable to explore ledger data using the newly added financial dimensions. With\nthis capability, when Entity store is refreshed, all available Financial\ndimensions are expanded within corresponding data tables. As a user, you can\nslice and dice your Power BI reports with ease.\n\nReady-made Power BI reports in Finance benefit from this capability without a\ndeveloper having to make any changes. However, as a partner or an ISV developer,\nyou can model the ways in which financial dimensions are added to Entity store.\nWhen you define an aggregate measurement that is backed with financial dimension\nfields, Entity store refresh automatically expands the aggregate measurement by\nadding additional tables and relationships into the data model. \n\nYou can empower your users to create Power BI reports that leverage this\ncapability. When you define a report with modeled financial dimensions, they can\nbe refreshed to include expanded fields.\n\nFor more information, see [Add financial dimensions to aggregate measurements](/dynamics365/unified-operations/dev-itpro/analytics/add-financial-dimensions-aggregate-measurements).\n\nPurchase spend analysis Power BI reports \n-----------------------------------------\n\nThe Purchase spend analysis content pack for Microsoft Power BI was created for\npurchasing managers and managers who are responsible for budgets. It's designed\nto help them monitor purchase spending. It uses purchase transactional data from\nDynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, Enterprise edition and provides both an\naggregate view of the company-wide purchase figures and a breakdown of purchase\nspending by vendor and product. Reports highlight changes in purchase spending\nover time. Therefore, they can be used to alert managers about positive and\nnegative spending trends for individual vendors and products. Charts show\npurchase spending for different procurement categories and vendor groups.\nCategory and regional managers might find it useful to use these charts to help\nidentify changes in spending behavior. The content pack lets purchase managers\nand managers who are responsible for budgets to analyze purchase spending in the\nfollowing ways: \n\n-   Year-to-date purchase (by vendor group and individual vendors, procurement\n    category and individual products, and vendor location).\n\n-   Year-over-year purchase change (by vendor group and procurement category).\n\nThe Purchase spend analysis Power BI content pack is available via the Lifecycle\nServices (LCS) Asset library and as an embedded report in Dynamics 365 for\nFinance and Operations, Enterprise edition.  \nFor more information, see [Purchase content pack for Power BI](/dynamics365/unified-operations/dev-itpro/analytics/purchase-content-pack-for-power-bi).\n\nPurchasing analysis Power BI content\n------------------------------------\n\nThe Purchasing analytics Power BI content pack equips purchasing managers with\ndeep insights that enable them to streamline their processes, and manage the\ncash flow while building relationships with suppliers.\n\nWhether you are a distributor or a manufacturer relying on strategic suppliers\nor a professional services company leveraging services of suppliers, as a\npurchasing manager, you are responsible for managing vital relationships. With\ncomprehensive visibility into orders, payments, and payables, you can manage\nprocesses and take action where needed.\n\nPower BI reports can be used foster relationships with your strategic suppliers\nby ensuring compliance with pre-negotiated payment terms. You can quickly dive\ninto exceptions and delays to take corrective action, as well as analyze trends\nand define alerts to be notified in case of exceptions.\n\nAs a purchasing manager, you contribute to the financial health of the company.\nPower BI reports let you identify large payments and decide whether you should\nnegotiate early settlement discounts proactively. You can also analyze options\nsuch as paying early versus waiting for the due date. By taking a strategic view\nof payments, you can help to proactively manage cash flow.\n\nMonitor and improve the effectiveness of your internal processes by reviewing\nthe case load of invoices. Get insights into key metrics such as Number of days\nspent from receipts to posting. Load balance invoice processing among your staff\nmembers by reviewing and forecasting the case load.\n\nComprehensive reporting and Dashboarding capabilities built into Power BI\nenables your purchasing managers to monitor, analyze and take action backed by\ndata. They can author reports and KPIs without help from IT and pin them to\nworkspaces for contextual insights.\n\nSales and profitability performance Power BI reports \n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nThis content pack was created for sales managers to monitor the key sales\nmetrics of revenue, gross profit, and profit margins. It uses sales\ntransactional data from Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, Enterprise\nedition and provides both an aggregate view of the company-wide sales figures\nand a breakdown of sales performance for customers and products. By highlighting\nchanges in the revenue and profit growth over time, reports can be used to alert\nmanagers about positive and negative trends for individual customers and\nproducts. Category and regional managers will find it useful to have charts that\ncompare revenue and profitability of different product categories and customer\ngroups to each other to single out laggards and leaders. A comprehensive report\nthat plots individual customer’s revenue versus profit margin offers account\nmanagers a data-backed foundation to attune their sales and marketing efforts to\neach customer’s respective profile. The Sales and profitability performance\ncontent pack enables sales managers to analyze sales performance by: \n\n-   Revenue, year-to-date (by customer group and individual customers, sales\n    categories, and individual products and geographies).\n\n-   Revenue change, year-over-year (by customer regions and sales categories).\n\nProfitability can be analyzed by:\n\n-   Gross profit and profit margin (by customer groups and product sales\n    categories).\n\n-   Gross profit change, year-over-year.\n\n-   Customer profitability (by revenue versus gross margin).\n\nThe Sales and profitability performance Power BI content pack is available via\nthe Lifecycle Services (LCS) Asset library and as an embedded report in Dynamics\n365 for Finance and Operations, Enterprise edition.\n\nFor more information, see [Sales and profitability performance Power BI content pack](/dynamics365/unified-operations/dev-itpro/analytics/sales-profitability-performance-content-pack).\n\nVendor payment analysis Power BI\n--------------------------------\n\nVendor payment analysis Power BI reports provide visibility into your open\ninvoices and posted vendor payments, enabling better decisions in your account\npayable processes. You can analyze overdue invoices, upcoming invoices that are\ndue in the future, as well as your discount history.\n\nFor more information, see [Vendor payment workspace](/dynamics365/unified-operations/financials/accounts-payable/Vendor-payments-workspace).\n\nWarehousing Power BI reports\n----------------------------\n\nWith Warehousing Power BI reports, the warehouse and supply chain\nmanager can easily take advantage of the rich visualization and dashboard\ncapabilities to analyze warehouse performance in the past, present, and future.\n\nWarehouse and operations managers can monitor the key inbound, outbound, and\ninventory metrics. This feature uses product and other transactional data from\nDynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, Enterprise edition to provide both an\naggregate view of the warehouse performance and a breakdown for customers,\nvendors, product groups, and product sites and warehouses. For more information,\nsee [Warehouse performance Power BI content](/dynamics365/unified-operations/dev-itpro/analytics/warehouse-power-bi-content).\n\n**Manufacturing**\n=================\n\nCross docking from production to transfer orders\n------------------------------------------------\n\nA new option allows you to do cross docking from a production or batch order to\nreleased transfer orders. This is relevant in manufacturing scenarios if the\nmaterial that’s been produced is immediately transferred to remote warehouse and\ndistribution centers and not stored at the production site. A work policy is\nused to query for cross docking opportunities. This includes the product and the\nlocation for the produced goods.\n\nFlushing principle Available at location \n-----------------------------------------\n\nA new flushing principle, Available at location, allows you to indicate that\nmaterial should be automatically consumed with a picking journal when it becomes\navailable on the production input location. The material either becomes\navailable when warehouse work for raw material picking is completed or it is\nalready available on the production input location, when it is released from the\nproduction order.\n\nThe new flushing principle can be helpful for long-running production orders,\nsuch as machine assemblies, from where material is picked on a continuous basis\nto be consumed in the area where the machine is assembled. With this new\nflushing principle, the material is automatically flushed when picking of the\nmaterial is completed. This will help you maintain a correct value of work in\nprogress without having to manually register and post the material consumption\neach time pick work is completed.\n\nOptimize scheduling for planned production orders with overlap jobs \n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe enhanced scheduling functionality optimizes how planned production orders\nare scheduled when there are overlapping jobs and resources with different\ncalendars. With this setup, you can avoid scheduling planned orders too early.\n\nProduction output location added to the resource group member \n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Resource group member is now part of the defaulting mechanism that you can\nuse to find the production output location when you report a production or batch\norder as finished. The Resource group member supports a definition of the output\nlocation per resource, which allows for more granularity than when the output\nlocation is defined per resource group.\n\nThe mechanism for defaulting the production output location, when reporting a\nproduction or batch order as finished, has so far been controlled by a\ndefaulting hierarchy where the search for an output location starts by the\nresource group that was used for the last operation in the production route. If\nno output location was defined on the resource group, the system will use the\noutput location defined on the warehouse as a fallback location.\n\nThe defaulting hierarchy has now been enhanced to also include the Resource\ngroup member. The Resource group member associates the resource to a specific\nresource group and is date efficient with an Effective date and an Expiration\ndate. The Resource group member is located on the **Resource group** page under\nthe **Resources** FastTab or on the Resource page under the **Resource groups**\nFastTab. The default production output location is now found by traversing the\nhierarchy in this order: Resource group member, Resource group, Warehouse.\n\nTurn off planning processes per company\n---------------------------------------\n\nMaster planning takes a snapshot of the item’s net requirements before planning.\nThe last step in the planning process is to take into consideration any changes\nthat may have occurred in the net requirements since the snapshot was taken. All\nchanges to the item’s net requirements, such as a sales order line quantity\nincrease or transfer order line quantity decrease, are logged in a table called\n**InventSumLogTTS**. This table is used to maintain the state of the dynamic\nplan, by keeping track of all changes in demand and supply that occurred since\nthe last master planning regeneration. This table is only cleaned up by a master\nplanning regeneration. If it is never cleaned, the table keeps growing and clogs\nsystem performance. If you do not intend to run master planning or any other\nplanning processes (explosion, production order scheduling with finite material,\nCTP delivery date control) in a specific company, set the **Master planning** \\>\n**Setup** \\> **Master planning parameters** \\> **Disable all planning\nprocesses** parameter to **Yes**. This will prevent records from being logged in\nthe **InventSumLogTTS** table.\n\nWhen a new company is created, this parameter is by default set to **Yes**. This\nmeans that if you intend to implement planning processes in a company, you need\nto manually set **Master planning** \\> **Setup** \\> **Master planning\nparameters** \\> **Disable all planning processes** parameter to **No**.\n\nVisual scheduling\n-----------------\n\nThe capabilities of the production Gantt have been enhanced to allow jobs in the\nproduction order view to be moved along with dependent jobs. You can switch the\nsequence of jobs on a resource. You can also trigger re-scheduling from the\nGantt and show resulting actions and delays, which allows the ability to\nre-assign a job to a different resource.\n\nWithdrawal kanban for warehouse processes\n-----------------------------------------\n\nSupport has been added for the withdrawal of kanban in production to replenish\nmaterial on the production floor for lean, discrete, and process manufacturing.\nThis makes it possible to release work for kanban picking for the withdrawal\nkanban, so that items can be picked from non-fixed locations in the warehouse.\n\nLean scheduling board\n---------------------\n\nA new scheduling board for kanbans has been introduced. The kanban board offers these main capabilities.\n-   A graphical overview of scheduled kanbans in a work cell for a selected period.\n-   Tools to schedule unplanned kanban jobs.\n-   Reschedule already scheduled jobs as a drag-and-drop activity.\n-   Reassign kanban jobs across time periods.\n-   An overview of the work cell capacity and capacity load that is updated when new kanban jobs are loaded to the board.\n-   Use of colors to distinguish between kanban jobs.\n-   Detailed information about the kanban and status icon showing when a kanban is overdue.\n\nIn the kanban schedule board, these call outs are added to key elements.\n- Menu bar\n- Filter fields\n- Button for unplanned jobs\n- Period node\n- Kanban job\n- Capacity bar\n- Time scale\n\n**Mobile**\n==========\n\nCost controlling mobile workspace\n------------------------\n\nThe **Cost controlling** mobile workspace provides an instant view of the current performance of cost centers by comparing actual costs against the budgeted costs. You can drill down to view statuses of individual cost elements.\n\nThe data in the **Cost controlling** mobile workspace is secured by user credentials. The cost center manager is only allowed to view data for the cost center that he owns. The access-level security is managed in the Cost accounting module.\n\nInventory on-hand mobile workspace\n------------------------\nWe know that every company has multiple shipments and multiple receipts of inventory each day, and that these movements constantly affect the inventory on-hand status. We have introduced a cross-organizational, on-hand view that can be accessed in any place, at any time, by people working in the warehouse, purchasing, sales, manufacturing, management, and other roles. We have enabled instant viewing of the on-hand status across facilities and enabled actions to be carried out from the mobile device such as: view on-hand across facilities, view current material reservations, view unreserved on-hand, view pending material movements (inbound/outbound), scan item numbers or license plates to query on-hand inventory, and create advanced view filters.\n\nThis mobile workspace empowers people to get mobile insights in current reserved/available stock levels at any time, in any facility.\n\nPurchase order approvals mobile workspace\n------------------------\nThis functionality allows users to review and approve purchase orders that have been submitted through workflow using their mobile device.\n\nSales orders mobile workspace\n------------------------\nView sales order details, sales order lines, status, customer contact information, order taker contact information, and historical shipping transactions. This mobile workspace will empower salespeople to gain valuable insights into customer information and sales orders at any time and in any place.\n\nVendor collaboration mobile workspace\n------------------------\nWith the **Vendor collaboration** mobile workspace, vendors can stay up-to-date on the purchase orders that have been sent to them for approval. This also allows vendors to view information about new and updated purchase orders and view contacts.\n\n\n**Other**\n=========\n\nConfiguration data project templates\n------------------------------------\n\nConfiguration data project templates provide over 20 pre-defined lists of\nentities for each module area. The templates are sequenced to handle entities\nthat are dependent on other entities. You can add one or more templates to a\nconfiguration data project and the sequences will align correctly.\n\nFor more information, see [Configuration data templates](/dynamics365/unified-operations/dev-itpro/data-entities/configuration-data-templates).\n\nUpgrade \n--------\n\nYou can upgrade from Dynamics AX 2012 to Dynamics 365 for Finance and\nOperations, Enterprise edition. The complete Dynamics AX 2012 database can be\nbrought forward, and your AX 2012 codebase can be upgraded to Finance and\nOperations. You can migrate from Dynamics AX 2009 to Finance and Operations via\na migration toolset to bring forward master data and opening balances.\n\nUpgrade is now more predictable, which reduces the overall cost of the upgrade\nprocess. Upgrade kicks off with an automated analysis phase, which defines the\npreparation tasks required to reduce the time and cost to upgrade, as well as\nthe ongoing future cost of Finance and Operations. Post upgrade, an automated\nvalidation phase provides statistics and metrics on the success of the upgrade\nprocess. The validation details can be used to quickly assess the state of the\nupgrade, so you can continue with functional testing and sign off.\n\nIn Finance and Operations there are no expensive upgrades needed to stay current\nand take advantage of continuous innovation. You can update to the latest\nversions of the product with a click of a button. The product supports rich\ncustomizations but the need for costly code upgrade is gone. Extensions-based\ncustomizations easily migrate with every upgrade. New features introduced in the\nproduct are opt-in, which means that business processes will not be affected by\nthe upgrade process. The Administrator can enable new features using the product\npost-upgrade, as they see fit. To minimize risks, upgrade enforces a workflow of\nan upgrade sandbox, validation, and then release to production.\n\nFor more information, see the following topics:\n\n- [Upgrade from AX 2012 to Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations](/dynamics365/unified-operations/dev-itpro/migration-upgrade/upgrade-overview-2012)\n- [Analysis: Use the upgrade analyzer to plan migration work](/dynamics365/unified-operations/dev-itpro/migration-upgrade/upgrade-analyzer-tool)\n- [Analysis: Estimate the effort to upgrade code](/dynamics365/unified-operations/dev-itpro/migration-upgrade/analyze-code-upgrade)\n- [Analysis: Deploy a sandbox environment](/dynamics365/unified-operations/dev-itpro/migration-upgrade/analysis-sandbox)\n- [Upgrade: Data upgrade in a development environment](/dynamics365/unified-operations/dev-itpro/migration-upgrade/prepare-data-upgrade)\n- [Upgrade: AX 2012 data upgrade tasks](/dynamics365/unified-operations/dev-itpro/migration-upgrade/data-upgrade-2012)\n- [Upgrade: Data upgrade in a sandbox environment](/dynamics365/unified-operations/dev-itpro/migration-upgrade/upgrade-data-sandbox)\n- [Validate: Tasks to complete after upgrade process](/dynamics365/unified-operations/dev-itpro/migration-upgrade/app-validation-process)\n- [Validate: Cutover testing](/dynamics365/unified-operations/dev-itpro/migration-upgrade/upgrade-cutover-testing)\n- [Validate: Functional testing](/dynamics365/unified-operations/dev-itpro/migration-upgrade/upgrade-functional-validation)\n- [Validate: Prepare for go live](/dynamics365/unified-operations/dev-itpro/migration-upgrade/upgrade-go-live-prep)\n\n**Project management \\| Accounting**\n====================================\n\nAllow a project resource to delegate timesheet entry and submission to any user\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nA timesheet resource can have a delegate assigned who can enter and submit\ntimesheets on behalf of the resource. This feature provides the ability to\nassign a delegate who may not be employed in the same legal entity as the\ntimesheet resource. The delegate does not need to be set up as a project\nresource. A new security role (Timesheet delegate user) has been created and\nmust be assigned to anyone who is designated as a timesheet delegate. To use\nthis feature, go to **Project management and accounting** \\> **Setup** \\>\n**Timesheets** \\> **All delegates**.\n\nAssign resources to draft work breakdown structure\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nThis feature allows project managers and resource managers the ability to assign\nresources to tasks in the work breakdown structure while it is in a draft\nstatus. Prior to this release, resources could only be assigned to tasks in work\nbreakdown structures that are published.\n\nBefore assigning resources to the tasks in the work breakdown structure, be sure\nto define your team for the project. To define the team for the project, go to\n**Project management and accounting** \\> **Projects** \\> **All projects** \\>\n**Project team and scheduling** tab.\n\nAfter the project team is defined, open the **Work breakdown** structure on the\n**Plan** tab of the project. Create the tasks for the project. The resource can\nbe assigned to the task while the work breakdown structure is still in draft\nstatus.\n\nManage or view a project work breakdown structure using Microsoft Project Client\n------------------------------------------------\n\nPlanning and maintaining a project schedule can be complex and project managers\nneed to use tools that help them manage this. This feature provides support to\nopen and manage the project work breakdown structure using the Microsoft Project\nClient Application. The project manager will be able to publish any changes back\nto Finance and Operations project work breakdown structure.\n\nTo enable the integration, a Dynamics 365 add-in is required to be installed in\nthe user’s client Microsoft Project application. This is done by opening the\n**Project management workspace**. Click the **Configure project client add-in**\nlink in the **Setup** section under **Links**.\n\nA work breakdown structure that is in a draft status can be opened in the\nMicrosoft Project Client Application by clicking **Open in Microsoft Project**\nfrom the project form (**Project management and accounting \\> Projects \\> All\nprojects**) or can be opened from within Microsoft Project Client by clicking\n**Open** in the **Dynamics 365 for Operations** tab. Users can make necessary\nchanges to the draft work breakdown structure, including assigning resources. If\na project team has already been added to the project in Finance and Operations,\nthe resource list will be populated with the team members. If a project team has\nnot yet been added to the project, you can select the resources and build the\nteam within Microsoft Project Client by clicking the **Resources** button on the\n**Dynamics 365 for Operations** tab. Edits to the work breakdown structure is\npublished back to Finance and Operations.\n\nProject time entry mobile workspace \n------------------------------------\n\nAs part of their daily work, project resources are often on-site or traveling.\nThe **Project time entry** mobile workspace lets users enter their billable or\nnon-billable time against a project on the mobile device of their choice.\nTherefore, project resources can record time entries anytime and anywhere. They\ncan also view time entries that have already been recorded.\n\nSpecifically, the **Project time entry** mobile workspace provides these\nfeatures:\n\n-   For any selected date, enter the number of hours that you spent on a\n    specific task.\n\n-   Search by project name or customer to find the project to enter time for.\n\n-   Specify the category and activity for the time that you spent.\n\n-   Record the time as billable or non-billable for the project.\n\n-   Optionally enter any external or internal comments.\n\nTo implement the **Project time entry** mobile workspace, see the related\ndocumentation for Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Operations on docs.microsoft.com.\nFor more information, see [Project time entry mobile workspace](/dynamics365/unified-operations/financials/project-management/project-time-entry-mobile-workspace).\n\nRename project stages \n----------------------\n\nThere are now 8 default project stages that can be used for the different\nproject types. This feature provides the ability to give the default project\nstages a different name for each legal entity and provide language translation\nsupport for the project stage name.\n\nTo view or edit the project stage name, go to **Project management and\naccounting** \\> **Setup** \\> **Project management and accounting parameters**,\nand select the **Project stage** tab.\n\nThe **Stage** column will display the default project stage names. To rename,\nyou need to enter the new project stage name in the **Project stage** column,\nand then select which project types the project stage applies.\n\nTo translate the project stage name to another language, simply click the\n**Language** drop-down button, and then select the language to translate.\n\nWorker can be a project resource in multiple legal entities at the same time \n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis feature provides support for a worker that has employment in more than one\nlegal entity to also be a project resource in multiple legal entities at the\nsame time. Prior releases only allowed a worker to be mapped to a single project\nresource.\n\nIncluded in this feature is the ability to view schedulable resources,\nnon-schedulable resources, or all resources in the **Resources list** page. This\nwill help project managers and resource managers better understand if a resource\nis schedulable.\n\nYou can enter an As of date to display resource data, such as sales price and\ncost price, as of a specific date. By default, the current date will be used.\nThis date will also be used to allow users to view the project resource data for\nworkers that may already be terminated, by changing the As of date to include\nwhen the worker was employed. To use this feature, go to **Project management\nand accounting** \\> **Project resources** \\> **Resources list**.\n\n**Retail** \n===========\n\nNext generation Retail extensibility framework\n----------------------------------------------\n\nThe POS extensibility framework has been redesigned and enhanced to simplify the\ndeveloper experience and to do seamless servicing. With the new extensibility\npatterns, you can customize the application without modifying the core retail\ncode. The new message-driven extensibility framework for POS allows you to\nisolate the extension from standard to support continuous integration and\ndeployment. You can manage and maintain your code at your own pace. With the new\nmodel, multiple ISVs/partners can customize the solution independently without\nany code merge. There is also support for multiple individual POS extension\npackages.\n\nThe benefits of this include:\n\n-   Simplified customization model.\n\n-   Easy maintenance.\n\n-   No code merge.\n\n-   Reduced cost and time to implement.\n\n-   Always on the latest and greatest version.\n\nWith this new extensibility framework, you can uptake any hotfix or upgrade\neasily without any code merge. Previously you needed to do a code merge and\nupdate your code if there were conflicts between your code and core application\ncode. If you also had ISV code, you needed to involve them in the process of\nservicing, retesting, and re-deploying it. In the new model, the core POS\nsolution is completely isolated from the extension layer, so you no longer need\nto do any code merge to uptake a hotfix or upgrade. You can apply a hotfix or\nupgrade seamlessly, and you can continuously service your own customizations\nwithout modifying the core application code.\n\nTo isolate the extension and core application in this release, we modified the\nextensibility patterns and sealed the retail components code from the Retail\nSDK. To customize the application in the sealed world, extension points and APIs\nare exposed to support all customization scenarios. The following component code\nis sealed/removed from the Retail SDK in this release and is available either as\nbinary or APIs for extension:\n\n-   POS (Modern POS and Cloud POS)\n\n-   Commerce runtime (CRT)\n\n-   Hardware station\n\n-   Channel DB\n\n-   Retail proxy\n\n**Even though the code is sealed or removed from the Retail SDK, we still\nsupport extensibility through the extension points and APIs. In the new model,\nyou will follow the extensibility pattern and customize the product without\ninline changes.**\n\nAll the retail components will be completely sealed, and no inline changes will\nbe supported, starting with this release. For any extension, you need to follow\nthe extensibility pattern and extend it. In addition to the above retail\ncomponents sealing, headquarters will also be sealed (no overlayering). In\nDynamics 365 for Retail, extensibility is supported only through extensions.\n\nConfiguration driven extension\n------------------------------\n\nThe attribute framework now supports configuration-driven development for\ncustomer and sales order entities. You can use the attribute framework to add\ncustom fields in customer master, sales order, cash and carry transactions, or\ncall center orders. In previous versions you needed to modify POS, CRT, channel\nDB. With this new model, this can be done through configuration without any code\nchanges.\n\nCustomer attributes - With the new customer attribute framework, you can use\nconfigurations to add new fields to the customer add/edit or customer details\nscreens in POS or HQ. Configure the customer attribute group, and POS and HQ\nwill automatically show the new attribute without any code change or\ncustomization. The screen layout designer will also show the customer attributes\nin the transaction screen - customer panel.\n\nOrder attributes - The attribute framework supports attributes in cash and carry\ntransactions, customer orders, and call center orders. You can edit and set\nvalues directly in HQ or in CRT/POS. All this can be done through\nconfigurations, without any database changes. (You can use customization for\ncore business logic only, not for basic CRUD operations.)\n\nCRT handlers and extensible enums\n---------------------------------\n\n**Granular CRT handlers** - We are continuously improving our code base to simplify the customization experience. We have enhanced many of the CRT handlers with more granular message handlers, so you can easily override or add triggers at specific extension points instead of owning the entire service or operation. For example, loyalty service is enhanced with more granular handlers to support customization at earn (sale and return), redeem, calculation, or validation. Previously, to skip some standard checks you needed to override the entire calculate service but now this can be done just by overriding or adding pre/post triggers for the validation check request handlers. Refer to the commerce runtime messages.chm file in the Retail SDK folder for the available requests and responses for customization.\n\n**Extensible enums** – We have enhanced the CRT to support extensible enums. Extensible enums can be now accessed using the new API exposed in CRT. Using this new API you can easily set/get or validate values based on the enum type. In previous versions you needed to manually define the enums in the CRT layer and type match it without direct mapping between Finance and Operations enums and CRT enums. With the new extensible API exposed in CRT, you can directly map between Finance and Operations enums and CRT enums without manually creating the enums in CRT. Multiple partners and ISVs can create extensible enums and use them in their code independently, without any code merge. For example, if you create a new discount type extension enum, the same enum will be available for you in CRT. In your code you can check if discount type is equal to my discount enum type, instead of manually validating with some hardcoded values.\n\nSupport for multiple Retail server extensions\n---------------------------------------------\n\nPreviously there was support for only one Retail server library, and all the\nextensions needed to be merged into one extension. If a customer wanted to use\nboth an ISV extension and a partner extension, they needed to either merge both\nsets of code or reference one extension library from the other. In this release,\nthe customer or partner can have multiple independent Retail server extensions,\nwhich will work seamlessly without any manual merge and build required.\n\nPOS extensibility enhancements\n------------------------------\n\nPOS extensibility framework is enhanced to support seamless servicing and\nextension without over layering or inline changes. In this release, the core POS\ncode is removed from the SDK to avoid inline changes, and we exposed the POS.API\nproject in the Retail SDK to support extensibility. By referencing this POS.API,\nyou can customize POS for your business scenario. The typescript retail proxy is\nalso enhanced to support proxy generation by extension to isolate extension from\nISVs and partners. The following list shows the extension points added in this\nrelease based on the new extensibility pattern. Refer to the Retail SDK\ndocumentation for the full list.\n\n-   New operation and views\n\n-   Modify existing views\n\n-   Add custom logic\n\n-   Order and customer attributes\n\n-   Triggers (pre-and post before any operations)\n\n-   POS Controls (refer the SDK documentation for all the controls information)\n\n    -   App bar, dialog, Custom controls, Data list, Date, Time\n\n    -   Menu, Pivot, Toggle switch\n\n    -   Loader\n\n-   Localization and logging frameworks\n\nEnhanced channel database extension model\n-----------------------------------------\n\nExtension to channel database can now be done using the extension schema without modifying the existing schema. All CRT database extension can be done in the extension schema, which supports CRUD operations for all extensions and for calling standard procedures and views from the extension. If you want to add new tables, procedures, functions, or views you can now do that all in the new extension schema. CRT data service is given access to extension schema to perform custom operations. Previously, you needed to modify the Microsoft schema to do this kind of change and it impacted the upgrade and hotfix uptake. You also needed to merge the custom script with the Microsoft script to avoid any overriding if there was any customization, so a partner or IT pro need to be involved in the upgrade process. With the new extension model, you can easily uptake a hotfix or upgrade without any script merge because the extensions are done in separate schema and maintained separately from the core scripts. Both are completely isolated, so the hotfix uptake will be as easy as a few button clicks.\nCRT data service now exposes the primary key for performing your custom extension scenario as post operation. For example, if you want to extend the shared retail parameters data service and fetch custom information, you can use the post triggers and do the extension. The post triggers expose the primary key and properties of the entities to perform any extension. From the extension, you can query the custom tables using the primary key and other information exposed through the entities. You can update the response with custom information as extension properties, which will be available in the client.\n\nCDX extensibility enhancements \n-------------------------------\n\nWe extended the Retail initialize feature to support custom table and field initialization for data sync between HQ and channel, and vice versa, without overlayering. The CDX seed data initialization class can be extended for custom tables and fields using the new extension points. These extension points will help you to initialize the custom tables and fields in different environments for data push and pull without overlayering. Previously, to achieve this you needed to modify the CDXDatagenerator class inline. Now all of this can be done using the extension. We have also enhanced the class to include a custom resource file to support custom tables and columns as extensions. Because the custom fields and tables information is added as an extension to the core class, you can now easily uptake any hotfix or upgrade without any code merge. You can also separate your code from different ISV and partner extensions. All extensions can be maintained and serviced separately, even if there are multiple ISV and partner extensions you can still perform servicing for your code or Microsoft code without disturbing or merging with the other extensions or core product code.\n\nRetail peripheral compatibility\n-------------------------------\n\nThe Peripheral simulator for Retail, included in Dynamics 365 for Retail and\nDynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, Enterprise edition, introduces an\nimportant update to the previously released peripheral simulator. New to the\nPeripheral simulator for Retail is a point of sale simulator that can test\nperipheral devices for compatibility with the Modern point of sale and Hardware\nstation without the need to deploy those components.\n\nDepending on the scenario, the POS simulator can simulate the peripheral\nbusiness logic built into the Modern POS, or it can simulate a standalone\nhardware station as it would interact with point of sale peripherals.\nTraditionally, testing devices for compatibility with the point of sale has\nrequired deployment of back office followed by configuration and deployment of\nthe point of sale application. With point of sale simulation capability, testing\nperipherals for compatibility no longer requires product knowledge or access.\nThis enables peripheral manufacturers to test their devices for compatibility\nwithout the need to ship physical devices to Microsoft or ISVs for testing.\n\nSupported devices:\n\n-   Line display\n\n-   Cash drawer\n\n-   MSR\n\n-   PIN pad\n\n-   Printer\n\n-   Scale\n\n-   Signature capture pad\n\n-   Bar code scanner\n\nFor each supported device, the POS simulator provides the ability to test device\nspecific capabilities for ad hoc testing, such as card swipe or displaying\nspecific strings of text on a line display. Each supported device also has a\nspecific self-test routine that is used for official device compatibility\ntesting. Results from compatibility testing can be sent to Microsoft to be\nlisted as approved for new deployments of Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Retail.\n\nFor a description of the Peripheral simulator, see [Retail Peripheral simulator](/dynamics365/unified-operations/retail/dev-itpro/retail-peripheral-simulator).\n\nFor more information about the compatibility program and how to participate,\ncontact <drpc@microsoft.com>.\n\nFor information about peripherals that have been previously tested by Microsoft,\nvisit [Microsoft-tested peripheral\ndevices](/dynamics365/unified-operations/retail/retail-peripherals-overview).\nThis page will also be updated with a link to the POS simulator-tested devices\nas soon as that page becomes available.\n\nIntegrated Retail workforce management\n--------------------------------------\n\nTo be profitable in reducing margin environment, retailers are constantly\nstriving to reduce their operational cost. For most retailers, retail staff cost\nis a significant portion of the operational cost and so by controlling this\ncost, they can make a significant impact on their bottom-line. Also, an\nempowered and productive workforce lends itself to improved customer experience.\n\nAn integrated workforce management capability for retail stores is now built on\nthe Common Data Services (CDS) stack. Because this feature is built using the\nlatest MPOS extensibility framework, it provides a mechanism for Microsoft to\ninnovate and deliver additional capabilities at a faster cadence, without\nbreaking existing customer customizations.\n\nThis release of retail workforce management provides the following capabilities:\n\n**For store managers**\n\n-   Create and publish shifts and schedules for workers in stores.\n\n-   Annotate shifts with instructions.\n\n-   Copy schedules from a previous week to the current week.\n\n-   Visibility of absence requests submitted by retail workers with the ability\n    to approve or reject requests.\n\n-   Visibility of shift swap and offer shift requests with the ability to\n    approve or reject requests.\n\n**For store associates**\n\n-   Visibility of shifts and assigned schedules, along with instructions for the\n    shift.\n\n-   Visibility of co-workers assigned to shifts.\n\n-   Submit absence requests.\n\n-   Submit request for shift swap with a co-worker. Submit request for ‘Offer\n    shift’.\n\nOmni-channel coupons\n--------------------\n\nTo improve the omni-channel experience, retailers can offer their customers call\ncenter coupons and retail discounts as part of one feature. Retailers can define\nand issue coupons that can be redeemed and tracked across all channels. In\nMicrosoft Dynamics AX 2012 and previous versions of Microsoft Dynamics 365 for\nOperations, call center coupons and discount codes on retail discounts were two\nunrelated features that shared a common purpose; they enabled discount targeting\nand discount controls for a retailer. With these features, a retailer could\ncontrol which customers are entitled to the discount.\n\nCall center coupons are merged with retail discounts to provide a unified\nexperience for managing and accepting coupons in all retail channels. The\ncombined experience uses the codes and bar codes from coupons to apply the\ndiscount value from retail discounts.\n\nFor more information about coupons, see [Create coupons for retail sales](/dynamics365/unified-operations/retail/retail-coupons).\n\nDiscounts - Quantity limit and exclude discount lines\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nYou can add a quantity limit to simple discounts and specify a number on a\ndiscount, which limits the maximum quantity of a product or a category of\nproducts. The quantity limit value can be set at the discount header, but it\nwill be applied at the discount line. When you set a quantity limit each\ndiscount line will have that limit applied independently.\n\nYou can also include or exclude property to discount lines. You can define the\nset of products a discount applies to with a combination of include and exclude\ndiscount lines. For example, you can have a discount with one discount line for\nthe **Fashion** category set to **Include** and a second discount line for the\nproduct **81327** set to **Exclude**. This discount would then apply to all\nproducts in the **Fashion** category tree except for product **81327**. All\npreviously existing discount lines are set to **Include**. This makes it easier\nfor merchandizers to define discounts for some scenarios.\n\nFor more information about discounts, see [Price adjustments and discounts](/dynamics365/unified-operations/retail/price-adjustments-discounts).\n\nPOS Inventory visibility improvements\n-------------------------------------\n\nWith the improved inventory visibility feature, cashiers can use POS to get a clear picture of the inventory status of any product in their store. They can also check the inventory status in other stores and warehouses of the company, thus helping customers to find the products that they want. The Inventory lookup form now displays the reserved inventory and incoming order quantity along with the total inventory to help the cashier with the following scenarios:\n\n- Customer is looking for a product that is not on the shelf and the cashier wants to verify if the current store or any nearby store has it in stock.\n- Store manager realizes that the stock of a product is running low and wants to know if this product has been ordered for replenishment.\n\nAn additional capability named \"Available to promise\" (also known as ATP) is now available in POS. This allows cashiers to see when and how much new stock is expected to be delivered to current and other stores and warehouses. This future product stock information can help the cashier answer questions regarding the stock quantities on any future date.\n\nPOS search improvements\n-----------------------\n\nWith the search improvement feature we have improved both product and customer search scenarios with the goal of enabling the cashiers and sales associates to quickly find what they are searching. The search bar now enables the cashiers to choose whether they want to search for products or customers prior to performing the search. The search bar can be configured to display the product suggestions while typing, thus empowering the cashiers to search the products quickly. The retailers also have the flexibility to configure whether the product search results should match 'all search terms' or match 'any search term'. Additionally, the product search now searches in the 'Searchable' property of the products as well, thus ensuring higher product discoverability. Customer search is smarter now and can search for customers with or without the phone number masks, which means that reliable results are returned every time.\n\nUpgrade and support for previous versions\n-----------------------------------------\n\n**Upgrade support** – For Dynamics AX 2012, you had the option to perform the\ndata upgrade for Retail, where all historical data, posted or unposted, was\nupgraded. Now you can upgrade from Dynamics AX 2012 R3 to the current version of\nDynamics 365 for Retail. The platform will support all the cumulative update\nversions of Dynamics AX 2012 R3 for upgrade. The back office and channel side\nare expected to be upgraded together for some customers on existing Dynamics AX\n2012 R3 versions while others can leverage the N-1 support. We will support all\nDynamics AX 2012 R3 versions from a database upgrade perspective for HQ. The\nRetailer will upgrade both HQ and Channel if you want to upgrade to Dynamics 365\nfor Retail without N-1 support.\n\nThe Retail customer will also have an option for N-1 support if they are using\nDynamics AX 2012 R3 CU11 or higher, if they don't want to disturb their existing\nstore and run it against the new HQ. After the database upgrade is complete in\nHQ, the retargeting of the new Dynamics 365 Retail channel side components will\nhappen as part of the LCS methodology, so the new channels can work with the\nupgraded DB. If the Retailer wants N-1 support for Channels when they upgrade to\nHQ, they will have to ensure that the channel is at least on 2012 R3 CU11 or\nabove.\n\n**Support for previous versions** – Now you can upgrade Dynamics AX 2012 R3 to\nDynamics 365 for Retail. N-1 Support will enable existing Dynamics AX 2012\ncustomers to adopt the cloud faster, with minimal interruption to their current\nbusiness process. N-1 Support will enable existing Dynamics AX 2012 R3 CU 11 and\nCU12 customers to be able to leverage the benefits of cloud for their businesses\nusing Dynamics 365 Operations as HQ in a hybrid model, while operating their\nstores in Dynamics AX 2012 R3 CU 11 or CU12. All of this occurs without\ninterrupting the existing infrastructure. For the initial phase, we are\ntargeting customers with Dynamics AX 2012 R3 CU 11 and 12 releases for N-1\nsupport. Because Dynamics AX 2012 store systems are on-premises and distributed,\nwe will support customers' existing Dynamics 2012 R3 store systems connecting to\nDynamics 365 Operations HQ after they upgrade to the CU 11 and CU 12 versions.\nThis will ensure minimal disruption in store operations.\n\nEnabling N-1 support requires customers to install the N-1 components that will\nenable the Dynamics AX 2012 R3 CU 11 or CU12 stores to connect with the new HQ.\nIf the customer is using a pre-CU 11 version, then they must upgrade to at least\nDynamics AX 2012 R3 CU 11 to leverage the N-1 support.\n\nFor details about Retail upgrade and N-1 support, see [Overview of upgrade and N-1 support](/dynamics365/unified-operations/retail/dev-itpro/overview-upgrade-n-minus1) and [N-1 installation and configuration](/dynamics365/unified-operations/retail/dev-itpro/overview-upgrade-n-minus1).\n\n\n**Supply chain management**\n===========================\n\nBatch and license plate confirmation \n-------------------------------------\n\nBatch confirmation and license plate confirmation has been added to this release\nof Finance and Operations. With this enhancement, using a mobile device, you can\nconfirm that the correct batch or license plate is being picked.\n\nIn previous versions, batch and license plate confirmation for items was not\nsupported. For more information, see [Batch and license plate confirmation](/dynamics365/unified-operations/supply-chain/warehousing/batch-and-license-plate-confirmation).\n\nConsignment inventory\n---------------------\n\nConsignment inventory capabilities have been extended to allow for batch and\nserial number dimensions.\n\nDemand replenishment for raw material picking\n---------------------------------------------\n\nWave demand replenishment has been enhanced to include production and Kanban\ndemand replenishment and raw material picking.\n\nIn previous versions, demand replenishment only included support for sales\norders and transfer orders.\n\nItem and warehouse migration process uses advanced warehouse management \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDuring a data upgrade, products are blocked if they are associated with a\nstorage dimension group with the Pallet ID inventory dimension active. However,\nafter the upgrade, you can use a set of migration options in the Change storage\ndimension group for items process to unblock products that were blocked during\nupgrade. As part of this process you can also use the Enable warehouse setup\nprocess to enable an existing warehouse to be used in warehouse management\nprocesses and get the pallet ID migrated to the License plate inventory\ndimension.\n\nSome of your items might already be associated with storage dimension groups\nwhere the Site, Warehouse, and Location inventory dimensions are active and\nphysically tracked. In this case, you can use the Change storage dimension group\nfor items process to enable those items to be used in warehouse management\nprocesses. This feature is useful if you want to use the warehouse management\nfunctionality for existing items.\n\nPiece picking confirmation \n---------------------------\n\nA new piece picking capability allows you to confirm each piece of inventory by\npicking or counting work on a mobile device. You can also use the quantity and\nunit of measure (UOM) that is associated with a scanned bar code. This new\nfunctionality works for receiving on inbound flows, including mixed license\nplate receiving, purchase order item, transfer order item, and load item.\n\nIn previous versions, it was not possible to, for example, verify item\nquantities to be picked by scanning item bar codes or to scan bar codes for\nlarger quantities.\n\nFor more information, see [Piece picking confirmation](/dynamics365/unified-operations/supply-chain/warehousing/piece-picking-confirmation).\n\nProduct work confirmation for cluster picking \n----------------------------------------------\n\nDynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, Enterprise edition now supports item\nscanning and verification in the cluster picking flow.\n\nWhen cluster picking is applied, item confirmation is crucial to verify the\nitems that are added to clusters. Now you can verify Items in cluster picking\nduring the cluster picking process. In previous versions, it was not possible to\nconfirm item bar codes and verify items using a bar code scanner. For more\ninformation, see [Product confirmation for cluster picking](/dynamics365/unified-operations/supply-chain/warehousing/cluster-picking-item-confirmation).\n\nProspect to cash integration capabilities \n------------------------------------------\n\nProspect to cash integration capabilities deliver first party integration\nbetween Dynamics 365 for Sales and Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations,\nEnterprise edition.\n\nThis solution leverages the strengths of the individual Dynamics 365 components\nand connects them via Common Data Service (CDS). While the data is flowing\nseamlessly between Finance and Operations and Dynamics 365 for Sales, customers\ncan carry out sales and marketing activities in Dynamics 365 for Sales and\nhandle the order fulfillment with inventory management in Finance and\nOperations. This solution provides powerful integration with a flexible solution\nand simplification of the integration process, without dependency on third-party\nsolutions. These advancements offer the best of both worlds, each with\nsignificant productivity enhancements that help businesses and workers achieve\nmore.\n\n-   Maintain accounts in Dynamics 365 for Sales and sync them to Finance and\n    Operations as customers.\n\n-   Maintain contacts in Dynamics 365 for Sales and sync them to Finance and\n    Operations.\n\n-   Maintain products in Finance and Operations and sync them to Dynamics 365\n    for Sales.\n\n-   Create quotes in Dynamics 365 for Sales and sync them to Finance and\n    Operations.\n\n-   Generate sales orders in Dynamics 365 for Sales for existing products and\n    sync them to Finance and Operations.\n\n-   Generate invoices in Finance and Operations and sync them to Dynamics 365\n    for Sales.\n\n**Easy access to data through the power of Common Data Service**  \nThe solution leverages the power of Azure Public Cloud and the combined data\nwill be available via Common Data Service. This enables business users to\naccess, visualize, share, and modify the unified Sales and Operations data\nthrough Power Apps, Power BI, or create workflow automations using Flow with\npre-defined templates for various business processes. This also means that Power\nBI dashboard lets users gain better insight into the business process\ninformation across the two systems.\n\n**Fast implementation**  \nIntegration between different ERP systems have traditionally been known for\ntheir rigidity, complexity, and slow deployments and implementations. This\nrelease is changing the game in this area by providing prepackaged integration\ntemplates. The templates provide the out-of-the-box experience for\nprospect-to-cash scenarios including synchronization needed for sales processes\nwith accounts, customers, contacts, products, of sales orders. In addition to\nthis an intelligent and easy-to-use setup experience, it is optimized to quickly\nadjust integration settings for your data structure and business needs.\n\n**Enhanced systems and flexible setup**  \nThe integration comes with a rich solution to optimize the experience and allow\nfor complex process flows between Dynamics 365 for Sales and Dynamics 365 for\nFinance and Operations, Enterprise edition. Finance and Operations, optimized to\nsupport integration with enhanced entities and Dynamics 365 for Sales is\noptimized with a solution.\n\nPunch-out to external catalog from purchase requisition \n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nEmployees can now punch-out to external shopping sites from a purchase\nrequisition. It only takes one click on a requisition line action and a\nselection of one of the available catalogs as shown on the screenshot. This\nmeans that you don't need to maintain a copy of the vendor catalog and risk that\nthe information is out of date. Instead, employees can browse the external\ncatalog on the vendor's shopping site, and select the items that they want.\nAfter they've finished, lines will be created for those items and they can be\nadded to the requisition.\n\nWhen you set up the external catalog, you set it up across all legal\nentities for which the vendor you choose is set up. The employees access to the\nexternal catalog is determined by the procurement categories that are set up for\nthe catalog and purchasing policies. \n\nThe cXML protocol is used to communicate between Finance and Operations and the\nexternal catalog residing at the vendor's system.\n\nFor more information, see [Use external catalogs for PunchOut eProcurement](/dynamics365/unified-operations/supply-chain/procurement/use-external-catalogs-for-punchout).\n\nSystem grouping on an open work list \n-------------------------------------\n\nYou can define your own filters to filter work lists. If, for example, you want\nto group work by load ID, or by a specific sales order production order, you can\nset up the filtering from the work list menu item.\n\nIn previous versions, the filtering options were limited to work group and it\nwas not possible to filter or group work using work lists.\n\nVendor collaboration\n--------------------\n\nVendor collaboration was enabled in earlier releases. In Dynamics 365 for\nFinance and Operations, Enterprise edition, we have enabled a seamless\nconsumption of changes to a purchase order when a vendor accepts or suggests\nchanges to a purchase order in the vendor collaboration interface and returns\nthe changed purchase order to the purchasing professionals.\n\n-   The vendor’s acceptance of the purchase order without changes will\n    automatically update the confirmed delivery date on the purchase order, and,\n    optionally, confirm the order.\n\n-   The vendor’s suggested changes in quantities or delivery dates or the\n    purchase order header info can easily be transferred to the purchase order.\n    This is a one-click action for purchasing professionals when they receive\n    the response with the suggested changes from the vendor.\n\nBoth improvements will reduce time spent in the purchasing department and allow\nthe procurement personnel to handle their tasks more efficiently.\n\nFor more information, see [Vendor collaboration with external vendors](/dynamics365/unified-operations/supply-chain/procurement/vendor-collaboration-work-external-vendors).\n\nWarehousing\n-----------\n\nImprovements have been made to the cycle counting process by allowing partial\nlocation counting. This helps to ensure data integrity while using the\nwarehousing system.\n\nThe integration between production and warehouse has been improved by enhancing\nthe following features:\n\n-   Opportunistic X-dock for transfer order when reporting as finished.\n\n-   Pick for withdrawing kanbans.\n\n-   Enable demand replenishment for raw material picking.\n\n-   Enable ability to assign a resource instead of resource group at output\n    location.\n\nUsability has been improved by adding the following capabilities:\n\nThroughout the distribution center operations, enabling piece-by-piece picking\nand product confirmation for cluster picking processes.\n\n-   Batch ID and License plate ID confirmation scan.\n\n-   Ability to combine system grouping with work list menu items.\n\nFor the next major release, the following features are currently planned and\nmore will be added to this list:\n\n-   Allow reservation hierarchy to shift from batch below to batch above for the\n    same item, allowing for ad-hoc reservation of specific batches.\n\n-   Improve the rewaving process to increase the visibility of the pick work\n    created.\n\n-   Support a split load scenario for the outbound flow.\n\n-   Allow to release for a partial quantity of the finished good and release per\n    operation number.\n\n-   Allow for partial quantity of the opportunistic X-dock to transfer when\n    reporting as finished.\n\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,978],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"# required metadata\n\ntitle: What's new or changed in Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, Enterprise edition July 2017 update\ndescription: This topic describes features that are either new or changed in Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, Enterprise edition July 2017 update.
