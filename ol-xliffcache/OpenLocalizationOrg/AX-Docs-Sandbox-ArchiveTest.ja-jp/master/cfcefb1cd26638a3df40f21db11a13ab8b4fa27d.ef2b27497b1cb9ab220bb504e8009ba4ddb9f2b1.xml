Go to Fixed assets > Periodic tasks > Impairment recognition (Method I: on a bigger group than CGU).\n    * For method 2, go to Fixed assets > Periodic tasks > Impairment recognition (Method II: Allocate carrying amount of shared asset / goodwill to CGUs).  \n2. Click New.\n3. In the CGU group field, type a value.\n4. In the Date field, enter a date.\n    * Enter the date on which to post the impairment transaction.  \n5.
