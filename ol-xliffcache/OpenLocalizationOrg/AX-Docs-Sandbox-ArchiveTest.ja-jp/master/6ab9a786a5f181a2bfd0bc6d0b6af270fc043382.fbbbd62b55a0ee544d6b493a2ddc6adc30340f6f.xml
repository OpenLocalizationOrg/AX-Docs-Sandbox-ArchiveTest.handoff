Reduction entries are a special accounting treatment for fixed assets that you acquire by using a government subsidy. You can use them to defer the corporate income tax for those assets throughout their service life. \n\nWhen you acquire a fixed asset by using a government subsidy, the subsidy is treated as taxable revenue. However, if you account for the whole government grant as revenue, the result is a large amount of corporate income tax, which reduces the subsidizing effect of the grant. Therefore, a special accounting treatment called a reduction entry is permitted. Basically, reduction entries defer the corporate income tax throughout the service life of the fixed asset that is acquired. Two types of accounting treatment are allowed:\n\n-   **Direct-off method** – The amount of the government subsidy is deducted directly from the acquisition cost of the fixed asset.\n-   **Reserve method** – The amount of the government subsidy is maintained as a separate value on the equity side of the balance sheet. The government subsidy amount doesn't affect the net book value of the fixed asset.\n\nYou can set up a fixed asset posting profile for reduction entries. You can also set up accounts for the transactions of the **Disposal** type. The transaction amounts are retrieved from these accounts when you post a fixed asset with a reduction entry.\n\n## Prerequisites\nThe following table shows the prerequisites that must be in place before you start.\n\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"header\">\n<th>Category</th>\n<th>Prerequisite</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td>Country/region</td>\n<td>The primary address for the legal entity must be in Japan.
