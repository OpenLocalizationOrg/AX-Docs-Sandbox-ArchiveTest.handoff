To create the formula lines, you can use the Copy function to copy an existing formula that has most of the ingredients that you need. You can then make any necessary changes to the individual lines in the new version. By using the Copy function, you do not have to create multiple formulas that are almost identical. The demo data company used to create this task is USP2.\n\n\n## Create a formula\n1. Go to Product information management > Bills of materials and formulas > Formulas.\n2. Click New.\n3. In the Formula field, type a value.\n4. In the Name field, type a value.\n    * Type a meaningful name for the formula.  \n5. In the Site field, click the drop-down button to open the lookup.\n6. In the list, click the link in the selected row.\n7. In the Item group field, click the drop-down button to open the lookup.\n8. In the list, find and select the desired record.\n9. In the list, click the link in the selected row.\n10. Click Save.\n\n## Copy formula lines\n1. On the Action Pane, click Formula.\n2. Click Copy.\n3.
