The fuel index region specifies which region the fuel index should apply to, and the fuel index specifies a fuel price for a particular period of time. To reflect the change in fuel prices over time, you can associate multiple fuel indexes with a carrier.  These tasks are normally done by a transportation coordinator. You can use this procedure in demo data company USMF or using your own data.\n\n\n## Create a fuel index region\n1. Go to Transportation management > Setup > Fuel indexes > Fuel index regions.\n    * First you have to create the different regions, where you operate and calculate different fuel surcharges.  \n2. Click New.\n3. In the Region field, type a value.\n4. In the Name field, type a value.\n5. Click Save.\n\n## Create a fuel index\n1. Go to Transportation management > Setup > Fuel indexes > Fuel indexes.\n    * For the regions you have set up you need to enter the current prices for the fuel.  \n2. Click New.\n3. In the Region field, click the drop-down button to open the lookup.\n4. In the list, click the link in the selected row.\n5. In the Price per gallon field, enter a number.\n6. In the Effective start date and time field, enter a date and time.\n7. Click Save.\n\n## Create a Carrier fuel index\n1. Go to Transportation management > Setup > Fuel indexes > Carrier fuel indexes.\n2. Click New.\n3. In the Carrier fuel index field, type a value.\n4. In the Description field, type a value.\n5. Click New.\n6. In the Effective start date and time field, enter a date and time.\n7. In the PPG From field, enter a number.\n    * In this example, you can set PPG From field to 1.95.  \n8. In the PPG To field, enter a number.\n    * In this example you can set the PPG To field to 2.  \n9. In the Percentage field, enter a number.\n    * In this example you can set the percentage to 3.  \n10. In the Currency field, click the drop-down button to open the lookup.\n11. In the list, find and select the desired record.\n12. In the list, click the link in the selected row.\n13. Click Save.\n\n","nodes":[{"pos":[5,630],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"# required metadata \n \ntitle: Set up a carrier fuel index\ndescription: This guide shows how to create a fuel index region, a fuel index and a carrier fuel index. \nauthor: BibiSp\nmanager: AnnBe \nms.date: 11/14/2016\nms.topic: business-process \nms.prod:  \nms.service: dynamics-ax-applications \nms.technology:  \n \n# optional metadata \n \n# ms.search.form:   \naudience: Application User \n# ms.devlang:  \nms.reviewer: bibis\nms.search.scope: Operations \n# ms.tgt_pltfrm:  \n# ms.custom:  \nms.search.region: Global\nms.search.industry: Distribution\nms.author: bibis\nms.search.validFrom: 2016-06-30 \nms.dyn365.ops.version: Version 7.0.0 ","nodes":[{"content":"Set up a carrier fuel index","nodes":[{"pos":[0,27],"content":"Set up a carrier fuel index","nodes":[{"content":"Set up a carrier fuel index","pos":[0,27]}]}],"path":["title"],"extradata":"MT"},{"content":"This guide shows how to create a fuel index region, a fuel index and a carrier fuel index.","nodes":[{"pos":[0,90],"content":"This guide shows how to create a fuel index region, a fuel index and a carrier fuel index.","nodes":[{"content":"This guide shows how to create a fuel index region, a fuel index and a carrier fuel index.","pos":[0,90]}]}],"path":["description"],"extradata":"MT"}],"header":"# required metadata \n","yml":true},{"pos":[637,664],"content":"Set up a carrier fuel index","linkify":"Set up a carrier fuel index","nodes":[{"content":"Set up a carrier fuel index","pos":[0,27]}]},{"content":"This guide shows how to create a fuel index region, a fuel index and a carrier fuel index.","pos":[734,824]},{"content":"The fuel index region specifies which region the fuel index should apply to, and the fuel index specifies a fuel price for a particular period of time.","pos":[825,976]},{"content":"To reflect the change in fuel prices over time, you can associate multiple fuel indexes with a carrier.","pos":[977,1080]},{"content":"These tasks are normally done by a transportation coordinator.","pos":[1082,1144]},{"content":"You can use this procedure in demo data company USMF or using your own data.","pos":[1145,1221]},{"pos":[1227,1253],"content":"Create a fuel index region","linkify":"Create a fuel index region","nodes":[{"content":"Create a fuel index region","pos":[0,26]}]},{"content":"Go to Transportation management &gt;
