You can run this recording in the USMF demo company and can use the suggested values. Typically, this procedure is performed by a quality clerk.  As a prerequisite, run the “Inspect the quality of goods” task recording. To process the approval of a nonconformance, the user who runs the task recording must have a “Name” value assigned on the Users page. To use the document notes, the user must also have Document handling activated in the user options. \n\n\n## Select a quality order\n1. Go to Quality orders.\n2.
