The following examples show how you can use the tracing information:\n\n-   View relations between the actions on planned orders to optimize the supply chain and inventory reservations.\n-   View relations to orders that are already approved. You can focus on automatically firming derived requirements and then prioritize orders more accurately.\n-   Simulate planning results to determine whether the planning parameters are optimal.\n-   Identify how information such as production dates, quantities, and priorities for an order were determined.\n\nYou can view details about futures and actions for a selected order. On the **Explosion** page, tracing information is available on the **Explanation** tab in the upper pane. Tracing occurs when you explode an order. To start tracing for the order, click **Update**, and then select the **Enable trace** check box. You can use the **Find text** field to search the log for specific information. Search results are highlighted in the tree.\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n[Master plans](master-plans.md)\n\n\n\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,735],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"# required metadata\n\ntitle: Use tracing for explosion\ndescription: This article explains how you can use tracing to explore the causes behind the outcome of an order explosion.\nauthor: YuyuScheller\nmanager: AnnBe\nms.date: 06/20/2017\nms.topic: article\nms.prod: \nms.service: dynamics-ax-applications\nms.technology: \n\n# optional metadata\n\nms.search.form: ReqTransExplosion\n# ROBOTS: \naudience: Application User\n# ms.devlang: \nms.reviewer: yuyus\nms.search.scope: Core, AX 7.0.0, Operations, UnifiedOperations\n# ms.tgt_pltfrm: \nms.custom: 19231\nms.assetid: 9bc9bfbe-a7a9-437b-a947-826229b0585a\nms.search.region: Global\nms.search.industry: Manufacturing\nms.author: roxanad\nms.search.validFrom: 2016-02-28\nms.dyn365.ops.version: AX 7.0.0\n","nodes":[{"content":"Use tracing for explosion","nodes":[{"pos":[0,25],"content":"Use tracing for explosion","nodes":[{"content":"Use tracing for explosion","pos":[0,25]}]}],"path":["title"],"extradata":"MT"},{"content":"This article explains how you can use tracing to explore the causes behind the outcome of an order explosion.","nodes":[{"pos":[0,109],"content":"This article explains how you can use tracing to explore the causes behind the outcome of an order explosion.","nodes":[{"content":"This article explains how you can use tracing to explore the causes behind the outcome of an order explosion.","pos":[0,109]}]}],"path":["description"],"extradata":"MT"}],"header":"# required metadata\n","yml":true},{"pos":[743,768],"content":"Use tracing for explosion","linkify":"Use tracing for explosion","nodes":[{"content":"Use tracing for explosion","pos":[0,25]}]},{"content":"This article explains how you can use tracing to explore the causes behind the outcome of an order explosion.","pos":[814,923]},{"content":"By enabling tracing, you can view information about the factors that contributed to the outcome of the explosion of a particular order.","pos":[925,1060]},{"content":"The following examples show how you can use the tracing information:","pos":[1061,1129]},{"content":"View relations between the actions on planned orders to optimize the supply chain and inventory reservations.","pos":[1135,1244]},{"content":"View relations to orders that are already approved.","pos":[1249,1300]},{"content":"You can focus on automatically firming derived requirements and then prioritize orders more accurately.","pos":[1301,1404]},{"content":"Simulate planning results to determine whether the planning parameters are optimal.","pos":[1409,1492]},{"content":"Identify how information such as production dates, quantities, and priorities for an order were determined.","pos":[1497,1604]},{"content":"You can view details about futures and actions for a selected order.","pos":[1606,1674]},{"content":"On the <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Explosion<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> page, tracing information is available on the <bpt id=\"p2\">**</bpt>Explanation<ept id=\"p2\">**</ept> tab in the upper pane.","pos":[1675,1780],"source":" On the **Explosion** page, tracing information is available on the **Explanation** tab in the upper pane."},{"content":"Tracing occurs when you explode an order.","pos":[1781,1822]},{"content":"To start tracing for the order, click <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Update<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept>, and then select the <bpt id=\"p2\">**</bpt>Enable trace<ept id=\"p2\">**</ept> check box.","pos":[1823,1920],"source":" To start tracing for the order, click **Update**, and then select the **Enable trace** check box."},{"content":"You can use the <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Find text<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> field to search the log for specific information.","pos":[1921,2000],"source":" You can use the **Find text** field to search the log for specific information."},{"content":"Search results are highlighted in the tree.","pos":[2001,2044]},{"pos":[2046,2054],"content":"See also","linkify":"See also","nodes":[{"content":"See also","pos":[0,8]}]},{"pos":[2065,2096],"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Master plans<ept id=\"p1\">](master-plans.md)</ept>","source":"[Master plans](master-plans.md)"}]}
