These steps can be performed in the GBSI company.\n\nTo complete these steps, you must first complete the steps in the “Create an ER configuration for generating reports in OPENXML format” task guide. In advance, you must also download and save the following templates locally for the sample report:\n\nhttp://msdynamics.blob.core.windows.net/media/2016/10/SampleVendPaymDocReport.docx\n\nhttp://msdynamics.blob.core.windows.net/media/2016/10/SampleVendPaymDocReportBounded.docx\n\nThis procedure is for a feature that was added in Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Operations version 1611.\n\n\n## Select the existing ER report configuration\n1. Go to Organization administration > Workspaces > Electronic reporting.\n    * Make sure that the configuration provider ‘Litware, Inc.’ is selected as active.  \n2. Click Reporting configurations.\n    * We will re-use the existing ER configuration that has been originally designed to generate the report output in OPENXML format.  \n3. In the tree, expand 'Payment model'.\n4. In the tree, select 'Payment model\\Sample worksheet report'.\n5. Click Designer.\n\n## Replace the Excel template with the Word template\n    * Currently, the Excel document is used as a template to generate the output in OPENXML format. We will import the report’s template in Word format.  \n1. Click Attachments.\n    * Replace the existing Excel template with the Word template that you downloaded earlier, SampleVendPaymDocReport.docx. Note, this template only contains the layout of the document we want to generate as ER output.  \n2. Click Delete.\n3. Click Yes.\n4. Click New.\n5. Click File.\n6. Click Browse. Navigate to and select SampleVendPaymDocReport.docx that you previously downloaded. Click OK.\n    * Select the template that you downloaded in the previous step.  \n7. In the Template field, enter or select a value.\n\n## Extend the Word template by adding a custom XML part\n1. Click Save.\n    * In addition to storing configuration changes, the Save action also updates the attached Word template. The structure of the designed format is ported to the attached Word document as a new custom XML part with the name ‘Report’. Note that the attached Word template contains not only the layout of the document we want to generate as ER output, it also contains the structure of data that ER will populate into this template at runtime.  \n2. Click Attachments.\n    * Now you need to bind the elements of the custom XML part ‘Report’ to the Word document parts.  \n    * If you're familiar with Word documents that can be designed as forms containing content controls that are bounded with elements of custom XML parts – play all steps of the next sub-task to create such a document. For more details, see this link https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Create-forms-that-users-complete-or-print-in-Word-040c5cc1-e309-445b-94ac-542f732c8c8b?ui=en-US&rs=en-US&ad=US. Otherwise, skip all the steps in the next sub-task.  \n\n## Get Word with custom XML part to do data bindings\n    * Open this document in Word and do the following:  - Open the Word Developer tab (customize the ribbon if it is not enabled yet).  - Select XML mapping pane.  - Select the ‘Report’ custom XML part in the lookup.  - Do mapping of the elements of the selected custom XML part and content controls of the Word document.  - Save the updated Word document on a local drive.  \n\n## Upload the Word template with custom XML part bounded to content controls\n1. Click Delete.\n2. Click Yes.\n    * Add a new template. If you competed the steps in the previous subtask, select the Word document that you prepared and saved locally. Otherwise, select the SampleVendPaymDocReportBounded.docx MS Word template that you downloaded earlier.  \n3. Click New.\n4. Click File.\n5. Click Browse. Navigate to and select SampleVendPaymDocReportBounded.docx that you previously downloaded. Click OK.\n6. In the Template field, select the document that you downloaded in the previous step.\n7. Click Save.\n8. Close the page.\n\n## Execute the format to create Word output\n1. On the Action Pane, click Configurations.\n2. Click User parameters.\n3. Select Yes in the Run settings field.\n4. Click OK.\n5. Click Edit.\n6. Select Yes in the Run Draft field.\n7. Click Save.\n8. Close the page.\n9. Close the page.\n10. Go to Accounts payable > Payments > Payment journal.\n11. Click Lines.\n12. In the list, mark or unmark all rows.\n13. Click Payment status.\n14. Click None.\n15. Click Generate payments.\n16. Click OK.\n17. Click OK.\n    * Analyze the generated output. Note that the created output is presented in Word format and contains the details of the processed payments.  \n\n","nodes":[{"pos":[5,815],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"# required
