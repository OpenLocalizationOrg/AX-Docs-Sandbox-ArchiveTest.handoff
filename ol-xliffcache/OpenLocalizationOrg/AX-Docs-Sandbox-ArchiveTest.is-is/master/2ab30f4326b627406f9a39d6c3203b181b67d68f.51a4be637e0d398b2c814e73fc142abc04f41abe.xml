This concept is named segregation of duties. For example, you might not want the same person both to acknowledge the receipt of goods and to process payment to the vendor. Segregation of duties helps you reduce the risk of fraud, and it also helps you detect errors or irregularities. You can also use segregation of duties to enforce internal control policies. Complete the following procedure to create a rule. You must be a system administrator to complete the procedure. The demo data company used to create this procedure is DAT. \n\n1. Go to System administration > Security > Segregation of duties > Segregation of duties rules.\n2. Click New.\n3. In the Name field, type a value.\n    * Enter a name for the rule.  \n4.
