In the Product name field, type a value.\n    * Enter a descriptive product name. The value defaults to the search name, but this can be changed by the user.  \n5. In the Product dimension group field, click the drop-down button to open the lookup.\n    * The product dimension group determines which of the 4 product dimensions that can be used to create product variants. This example uses a group with color and size.  \n6. In the list, find and select the desired record.\n7. In the list, click the link in the selected row.\n    * The default configuration technology is Predefined variant. This will be used for this example.  \n8. Click OK.\n\n## Select product dimension groups\n1. In the Color group field, click the drop-down button to open the lookup.\n2. In the list, find and select the desired record.\n3. In the list, click the link in the selected row.\n4. In the Size group field, click the drop-down button to open the lookup.\n5. In the list, find and select the desired record.\n6. In the list, click the link in the selected row.\n\n## Add dimension groups\n1. On the Action Pane, click Product.\n2. Click Dimension groups to open the drop dialog.\n3. In the Storage dimension group field, click the drop-down button to open the lookup.\n    * The storage dimensions help you control how items are stored and taken from inventory.
