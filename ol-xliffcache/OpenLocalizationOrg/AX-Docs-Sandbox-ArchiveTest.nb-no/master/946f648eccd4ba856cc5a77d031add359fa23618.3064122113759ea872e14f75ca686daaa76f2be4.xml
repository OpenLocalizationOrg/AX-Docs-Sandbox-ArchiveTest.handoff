Replenishment rules can be used to control how products are distributed to stores when using Cross-docking and Buyer´s push. Replenishment rules can be set up for stores or store groups. The weight defined for each line in a rule will control how the quantities of products will get distributed between the stores when using Replenishment rules as the distribution method in Cross-docking or Buyer´s push. This procedure uses the USRT demo company.\n\n1. Go to Replenishment rules.\n2. Click New.\n3. In the Replenishment rule field, type a value.\n4. In the Description field, type a value.\n5. Click Save.\n6. Click Add.\n7. In the list, mark the selected row.\n    * You can choose Replenishment hierarchy or Channel for the type. The value controls whether the selection in Name will be a hierarchy of channels or a specific channel.  For this example, leave it set as Replenishment hierarchy.  \n8. In the Name field, select a value.\n    * The default weight value is populated from the weight defined on the warehouse.  This weight can be used for the Replenishment rule or you can enter a new weight in the Weight field.  \n9. In the Weight field, enter a number.\n10. Click Add.\n11. In the list, mark the selected row.\n12. In the Type field, select 'Channel'.\n13. In the Name field, enter or select a value.\n14. In the Weight field, enter a number.\n15.
