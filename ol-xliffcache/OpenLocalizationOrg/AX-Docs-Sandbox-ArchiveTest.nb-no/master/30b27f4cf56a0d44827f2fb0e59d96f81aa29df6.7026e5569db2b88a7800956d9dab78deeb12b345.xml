The organization model has a significant effect on the implementation of Finance and Operations and on business processes. \n\nOrganizational hierarchies represent the relationships between the organizations that make up a business. Therefore, the most important consideration when you model organizations is the structure of your business. We recommend that you define organization structures based on feedback from executives and senior managers from functional areas, such as finance and accounting, human resources, operations, purchasing, and sales and marketing. When you are planning hierarchies, it is also important to consider the relationship between the organizational hierarchy and financial dimensions. You can set up multiple organizational hierarchies to represent different views of your business. By using financial dimensions, you can create reports based on these views. Work with your Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations partner to create hierarchies that address both organizational and statutory reporting needs. **Note:** Although you can use financial dimensions to represent legal entities without creating the legal entities in Finance and Operations, financial dimensions aren’t designed to address the operational or business needs of legal entities. The interunit accounting functionality in Finance and Operations is designed to address only the accounting entries that are created by each transaction. **Caution:** You shouldn’t decide how to model organizations based only on the information in this article. This documentation is a guide. You can work with your Finance and Operations Partner for additional guidance. Your Finance and Operations Partner has gained experience in various industries and across the customer base.\nDecide whether to model internal organizations as legal entities or operating units\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nYou must have at least one legal entity to represent your business in Finance and Operations. A legal entity can enter legal contracts and is required to prepare financial statements that report on its performance. In Finance and Operations, legal entities can be used for transactional business or for consolidation. This means that a legal entity in Finance and Operations does not necessarily represent a real entity in your business. For example, a company that participates in transactions can own subsidiary legal entities. In this scenario, a legal entity is required for transactions, and a virtual legal entity is required to consolidate the results and balances of the subsidiary legal entities. Internal organizations in your business, such as regional offices, can be represented as additional legal entities, or as operating units of the main legal entity. An operating unit is not required to be a legally defined organization. Operating units are used to control economic resources and operational processes in the business. For example, departments and cost centers are operating units. Some functionality in Finance and Operations works differently depending on whether the organization is a legal entity or an operating unit.

The following examples illustrate how intercompany transactions are handled. **Example 1: Headquarters provides services to regional offices and must charge the costs of those services to the regional offices.** If you model the regional office as a legal entity, you have the following options: **Option 1:** Headquarters creates a journal entry to cross-charge the regional office for the expense. The transactions cannot be aged. **Option 2:** Headquarters sends a purchase order for the services to the regional office. A sales order is automatically created in the legal entity for the regional office, with intercompany sub-ledger transactions. **Example 2: Headquarters procures and pays for service that is delivered to a regional office.** If you model the regional office as a legal entity, you have the following options: **Option 1:** The invoice and payment follow the regulatory requirements of headquarters. Headquarters can create a journal entry to cross-charge the regional office for the expense. The transactions cannot be aged. **Option 2:** The invoice and payment follow the regulatory requirements of headquarters. Headquarters can create an intercompany sub-ledger transaction. | Intercompany transactions among operating units are supported only through journal vouchers. An operating unit cannot issue or receive a purchase order, sales order, or invoice from another operating unit in the same legal entity.

The following examples illustrate how intercompany transactions are handled. **Example 1: Headquarters provides services to regional offices and must charge the costs of those services to the regional offices.** If you model the regional office as an operating unit, headquarters enters an expense transaction and codes it to the regional office. **Example 2: Headquarters procures and pays for service that is delivered to a regional office.** If you model the regional office as an operating unit, the invoice and payment follow the regulatory requirements of headquarters. The invoice can be coded to the regional office. On the income statement, use a balancing financial dimension to report costs for the regional office. |\n| Local tax requirements                   | A legal entity is subject to the tax laws of the tax authority in the country/region where the legal entity is registered. For example, a legal entity that is registered in Denmark is subject to Danish tax laws and regulations. In Finance and Operations, a legal entity can belong to only one country/region. The country/region that you select for the primary address of the legal entity controls the country/region-specific features that are available to that legal entity. For example, if the primary address of the legal entity is in Denmark, features that are related to Danish tax laws and regulations become available. Therefore, if your organizations are in different countries/regions and require different local tax options, you must set up the organizations as separate legal entities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Operating units use the country context of the parent legal entity.

(A CustomerSource logon is required.)strong&gt;Note: In Finance and Operations, a posting layer in the general ledger allows you to make adjusting entries to a parent company that uses a different accounting standard than the child company. For example, for a company that uses generally accepted accounting practices in the United Kingdom (UK GAAP), you can make adjusting entries in the posting layer. These entries can be consolidated into a parent company that uses generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in the United States. The adjusting entries do not affect UK GAAP reporting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Statutory reports must be created by using another application.

You can then roll up data from a department to a legal entity for statutory reporting, and from a department to a business unit for internal reporting. Departments can serve as profit centers. If you use departments, you do not have to use legal entities and business units as dimensions in the account structure. You can use just departments as a dimension. However, you must use both cost centers and departments as dimensions in the account structure if cost centers are used only as cost accumulators, and departments are used for revenue recognition.\n-   Model multiple hierarchies for operating units if you have complex requirements for reporting profit and loss.\n-   In a single legal entity, do not model multiple hierarchies for the same hierarchy purpose.\n-   Do not create a hierarchy for every purpose. Usually, you can use one hierarchy for multiple purposes. For example, one hierarchy of operating units can be assigned to all policy-related purposes.\n-   Create balanced hierarchies. In a hierarchy, all nodes that are the same distance from the root node are defined as a level. In a balanced hierarchy, only one type of operating unit can occur at each level, and the distance from the root node to each level is consistent. If there are intermediate levels between a department and a legal entity or a business unit, placeholder organizations may be required to create a balanced hierarchy.\n-   Do not model a separate hierarchy of operating units if the structure for legal entities is also your operating structure. A mixed hierarchy of legal entities and operating units may serve both purposes.\n-   Before you model major restructuring scenarios, use the hierarchy's effective dates to perform an impact analysis and a validation test.\n-   Use draft mode to change a hierarchy before you publish a new version in a production environment.\n-   Limit the number of people who have permissions to add or remove organizations from a hierarchy in a production environment. A smaller number reduces the chance that costly mistakes can occur and corrections must be made.\n\n\n\n\n\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,906],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"# required metadata\n\ntitle: Configure organizational hierarchy\ndescription: Before you set up organizations and organization hierarchies in Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, make sure that you plan how your business will be modeled.
