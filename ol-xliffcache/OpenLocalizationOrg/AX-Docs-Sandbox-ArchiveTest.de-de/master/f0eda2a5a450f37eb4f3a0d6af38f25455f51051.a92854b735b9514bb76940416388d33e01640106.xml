The financial issue transaction of USD 11.00 will be settled against the financial receipt that is dated February 1, and an adjustment of USD 1.00 will be made. The following inventory receipts will then contain open inventory quantities:\n\n-   February 1: A quantity of 1 at a cost of USD 10.00\n-   February 5: A quantity of 1 at a cost of USD 13.00\n\nTo set the cost of these two items to USD 15.00, use the on-hand adjustment option to adjust the open on-hand quantities as of the last inventory close period. **Note:** The posting date of the on-hand adjustment transaction will be the date of the last inventory close. This date can't be modified.\n\n\n\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,786],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"# required metadata\n\ntitle: Adjust on-hand inventory cost values\ndescription: Use the Adjustment of on-hand inventory page to adjust the cost value of the on-hand inventory quantities after an inventory close process is run.\nauthor: YuyuScheller\nmanager: AnnBe\nms.date: 06/20/2017\nms.topic: article\nms.prod: \nms.service: dynamics-ax-applications\nms.technology: \n\n# optional metadata\n\nms.search.form: InventAdjInventOnHand\n# ROBOTS: \naudience: Application User\n# ms.devlang: \nms.reviewer: yuyus\nms.search.scope: Core, AX 7.0.0, Operations, UnifiedOperations\n# ms.tgt_pltfrm: \nms.custom: 53231\nms.assetid: bc1fde9f-5ad9-4339-8ae8-e2839b792eb2\nms.search.region: Global\nms.search.industry: Manufacturing\nms.author: mguada\nms.search.validFrom: 2016-02-28\nms.dyn365.ops.version: AX 7.0.0\n","nodes":[{"content":"Adjust on-hand inventory cost values","nodes":[{"pos":[0,36],"content":"Adjust on-hand inventory cost values","nodes":[{"content":"Adjust on-hand inventory cost values","pos":[0,36]}]}],"path":["title"],"extradata":"MT"},{"content":"Use the Adjustment of on-hand inventory page to adjust the cost value of the on-hand inventory quantities after an inventory close process is run.","nodes":[{"pos":[0,146],"content":"Use the Adjustment of on-hand inventory page to adjust the cost value of the on-hand inventory quantities after an inventory close process is run.","nodes":[{"content":"Use the Adjustment of on-hand inventory page to adjust the cost value of the on-hand inventory quantities after an inventory close process is run.","pos":[0,146]}]}],"path":["description"],"extradata":"MT"}],"header":"# required metadata\n","yml":true},{"pos":[794,830],"content":"Adjust on-hand inventory cost values","linkify":"Adjust on-hand inventory cost values","nodes":[{"content":"Adjust on-hand inventory cost values","pos":[0,36]}]},{"content":"Use the Adjustment of on-hand inventory page to adjust the cost value of the on-hand inventory quantities after an inventory close process is run.","pos":[876,1022]},{"content":"You can use the <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Adjustment of on-hand inventory<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> page to adjust the cost value of on-hand inventory quantities after an inventory close process is run.","pos":[1024,1178],"source":"You can use the **Adjustment of on-hand inventory** page to adjust the cost value of on-hand inventory quantities after an inventory close process is run."},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Note:<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> To open the <bpt id=\"p2\">**</bpt>Adjustment of on-hand inventory<ept id=\"p2\">**</ept> page, on the <bpt id=\"p3\">**</bpt>Closing and adjustment<ept id=\"p3\">**</ept> page, select the record of a completed inventory close process, and then click <bpt id=\"p4\">**</bpt>Adjustment<ept id=\"p4\">**</ept> <ph id=\"ph1\">&amp;gt;</ph> <bpt id=\"p5\">**</bpt>On-hand<ept id=\"p5\">**</ept>.","pos":[1179,1388],"source":"**Note:** To open the **Adjustment of on-hand inventory** page, on the **Closing and adjustment** page, select the record of a completed inventory close process, and then click **Adjustment** &gt;
