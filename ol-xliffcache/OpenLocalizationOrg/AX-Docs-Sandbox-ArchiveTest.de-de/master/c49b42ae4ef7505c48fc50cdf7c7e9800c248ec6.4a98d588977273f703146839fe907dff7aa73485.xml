In the Name field, type a descriptive name for the register..\n5. In the Store number field, enter or select a value.\n6. In the Hardware profile field, enter or select a value.\n    * Hardware profiles are used to specify the retail peripherals that will be connected to the register, such as cash drawer and receipt printer.  \n7. In the Visual profile field, enter or select a value.\n    * Visual profiles are used to specify the images used in the POS background and login page as well as themes for the POS.  \n8. In the EFT POS register number field, type a value.\n    * The EFT POS register number is used to inform the payment processor which payment terminal is sending authorization requests. This value is often called the \"Terminal ID\" or “TID”. The TID can generally be found on a sticker on the payment device.  \n9.
