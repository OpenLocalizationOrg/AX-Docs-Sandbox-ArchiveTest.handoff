When you create the periodic journal, you specify the period interval for the recurrence, such as days or months. This task guide will create a periodic journal with a monthly recurrence.\n\n\n\n1. Go to General ledger > Periodic tasks > Periodic journals.\n2. Click New.\n3. In the Name field, enter or select a value.\n4. In the list, click the link in the selected row.\n5. In the Description field, type a value.\n    * The description will be the name of the Periodic journal when retrieved later so make sure to give it a relevant name.  \n6. Click Lines.\n    * A periodic journal will typically include several journal lines. this task guide will however only add one line.  \n7. In the Date field, enter a date.\n    * The Date field contains the posting date for the next transfer to the daily journal. For journals that will be retrieved each month it is recommended to use the date in the month when it will be posted, typically the first or last date in the period. It is possible to leave the Date field blank and to give a date when the journal is retrieved, using the Empty date field.    The field is automatically updated to the next recurring date when transactions are retrieved.  \n8. In the Account field, specify the desired values.\n9. In the Description field, type a value.\n10. Close the page.\n11. In the Debit field, enter a number.\n12. In the Offset account field, specify the desired values.\n13. In the Unit field, select 'Months'.\n14. In the Number of units field, enter '1'.\n15. In the Last date field, enter a date.\n    * Entering last date in the preceding period will prevent that the recurring journal by mistake is created in the wrong starting period. Last date will later on be updated each time the periodic journal is retrieved.  \n16. Click Save.\n17. Go to Default dashboard.\n18. Go to General ledger > Journal entries > General journals.\n19. Click New.\n20. In the Name field, enter or select a value.\n21. In the list, find and select the desired record.\n22. In the list, click the link in the selected row.\n23.
