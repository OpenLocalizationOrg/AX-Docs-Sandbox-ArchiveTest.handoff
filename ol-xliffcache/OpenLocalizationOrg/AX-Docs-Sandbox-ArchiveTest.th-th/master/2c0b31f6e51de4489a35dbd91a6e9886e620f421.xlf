        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="118" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>The main advantage of this ATP calculation method is that it can handle cases where the sum of issues among receipts is more than the latest receipt (for example, when a quantity from an earlier receipt must be used to meet a requirement).</source>

        <trans-unit id="119" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>The “cumulative ATP with look-ahead” calculation method includes all issues until the cumulative quantity to receive exceeds the cumulative quantity to issue.</source>

        <trans-unit id="120" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Therefore, this ATP calculation method evaluates whether some of the quantity from an earlier period can be used in a later period.</source>

        <trans-unit id="121" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>The ATP quantity is the uncommitted inventory balance in the first period.</source>

        <trans-unit id="122" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Typically, it's calculated for each period in which a receipt is scheduled.</source>

        <trans-unit id="123" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>The program calculates the ATP period in days and calculates the current date as the first date for the ATP quantity.</source>

          <source>In the first period, ATP includes on-hand inventory minus customer orders that are due and overdue.</source>

          <source>ATP is calculated by using the following formula:</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="126" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>ATP = ATP for the previous period + Receipts for the current period – Issues for the current period – Net issue quantity for each future period until the period when the sum of receipts for all future periods, up to and including the future period, exceeds the sum of issues up to and including the future period.</source>

          <source>When there are no more issues or receipts to consider, the ATP quantity for the following dates is the same as the latest calculated ATP quantity.</source>

        <trans-unit id="128" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>If not all the dimensions that are used for an item are given when the ATP check is completed, they can still be specified on the issue and receipts.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="129" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>In this case, in the ATP calculation, the receipts and issues must be aggregated to the existing dimensions to reduce the number of receipt and issue lines that are used in the ATP calculation.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="130" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>The ATP quantity that is shown is always greater than or equal to 0 (zero).</source>

          <source>If the calculation returns a negative ATP quantity (for example, if the quantity that was previously promised exceeds the available quantity), the program automatically sets the quantity to <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>0<ept id="p1">**</ept>.</source>
