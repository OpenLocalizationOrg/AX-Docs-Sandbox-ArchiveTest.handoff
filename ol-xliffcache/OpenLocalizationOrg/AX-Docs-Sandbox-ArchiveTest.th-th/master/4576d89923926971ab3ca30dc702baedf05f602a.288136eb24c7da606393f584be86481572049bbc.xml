Click Print check copy.\n    * Run the format to re-print the selected cheques.  \n    * Review the created output. Note that the selected cheques have been re-printed. The company logo and labels are not printed out since they are presented on the pre-printed form.  \n\n## Modify the mapping of the imported data model\n1. Close the page.\n2. Close the page.\n3. Go to Organization administration > Electronic reporting > Configurations.\n4. In the tree, select 'Model for cheques'.\n5. Click Designer.\n6. Click Map model to datasource.\n7. Click Designer.\n    * We will change the binding of the data model’s signature item to get the signature image from the file that has been attached to the cheque layout record which is associated with the selected bank account.  \n8. Turn Show details off.\n9. In the tree, expand 'layout'.\n10. In the tree, expand 'layout\\signature'.\n11. In the tree, select 'layout\\signature\\image = chequesaccount.'<Relations'.BankChequeLayout.Signature1Bmp'.\n12. In the tree, expand 'chequesaccount'.\n13. In the tree, expand 'chequesaccount\\<Relations'.\n14. In the tree, expand 'chequesaccount\\<Relations\\BankChequeLayout'.\n15. In the tree, expand 'chequesaccount\\<Relations\\BankChequeLayout\\<Relations'.\n16. In the tree, expand 'chequesaccount\\<Relations\\BankChequeLayout\\<Relations\\<Documents'.\n17. In the tree, select 'chequesaccount\\<Relations\\BankChequeLayout\\<Relations\\<Documents\\getFileContentAsContainer()'.\n18. Click Bind.\n19. Click Save.\n20. Close the page.\n21. Close the page.\n22. Close the page.\n23. Close the page.\n\n## Run format using the adjusted model mapping\n1. Go to Cash and bank management > Bank accounts > Bank accounts.\n2. Use the Quick Filter to find records. For example, filter on the Bank account field with a value of 'USMF OPER'.\n3. On the Action Pane, click Set up.\n4. Click Check.\n5. Click Print test.\n6.
