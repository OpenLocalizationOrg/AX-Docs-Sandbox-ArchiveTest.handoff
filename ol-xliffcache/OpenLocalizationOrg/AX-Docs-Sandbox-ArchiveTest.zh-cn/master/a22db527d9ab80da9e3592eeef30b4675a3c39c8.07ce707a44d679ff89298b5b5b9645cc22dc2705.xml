The demo data company used to create this procedure is USMF. This is the final procedure out of seven which explains the production order lifecycle.\n\n\n## End a production order\n1. Go to Production control > Production orders > All production orders.\n    * Select a production order that has the status Reported as finished.  \n2. On the Action Pane, click Production order.\n3. Click End.\n    * On this page, you can confirm that you want to end the production order.  \n4. Click the General tab.\n5. In the Date field, enter a date.\n6. In the Scrap method field, select 'Allocation'.\n    * When you select the Allocation method, costs from the scrapped materials are added to the finished goods.  \n7. Click OK.\n\n## Validate calculation results\n1. On the Action Pane, click Manage costs.\n2. Click View cost comparison.\n    * After you have ended the production order, you can compare the estimated cost price against the realized cost price to get an overview of the production variances.  \n\n","nodes":[{"pos":[5,596],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"# required metadata \n \ntitle: End a production order\ndescription: This procedure shows how to end a production order. \nauthor: johanhoffmann\nmanager: AnnBe \nms.date: 11/11/2016\nms.topic: business-process \nms.prod:  \nms.service: dynamics-ax-applications \nms.technology:  \n \n# optional metadata \n \n# ms.search.form:   \naudience: Application User \n# ms.devlang:  \nms.reviewer: yuyus\nms.search.scope: Operations \n# ms.tgt_pltfrm:  \n# ms.custom:  \nms.search.region: Global\nms.search.industry: Manufacturing\nms.author: johanho\nms.search.validFrom: 2016-06-30 \nms.dyn365.ops.version: Version 7.0.0 ","nodes":[{"content":"End a production order","nodes":[{"pos":[0,22],"content":"End a production order","nodes":[{"content":"End a production order","pos":[0,22]}]}],"path":["title"],"extradata":"MT"},{"content":"This procedure shows how to end a production order.","nodes":[{"pos":[0,51],"content":"This procedure shows how to end a production order.","nodes":[{"content":"This procedure shows how to end a production order.","pos":[0,51]}]}],"path":["description"],"extradata":"MT"}],"header":"# required metadata \n","yml":true},{"pos":[603,625],"content":"End a production order","linkify":"End a production order","nodes":[{"content":"End a production order","pos":[0,22]}]},{"content":"This procedure shows how to end a production order.","pos":[695,746]},{"content":"The demo data company used to create this procedure is USMF.","pos":[747,807]},{"content":"This is the final procedure out of seven which explains the production order lifecycle.","pos":[808,895]},{"pos":[901,923],"content":"End a production order","linkify":"End a production order","nodes":[{"content":"End a production order","pos":[0,22]}]},{"content":"Go to Production control &gt; Production orders &gt; All production orders.","pos":[927,996],"source":"Go to Production control > Production orders > All production orders."},{"content":"Select a production order that has the status Reported as finished.","pos":[1003,1070]},{"content":"On the Action Pane, click Production order.","pos":[1076,1119]},{"content":"Click End.","pos":[1123,1133]},{"content":"On this page, you can confirm that you want to end the production order.","pos":[1140,1212]},{"content":"Click the General tab.","pos":[1218,1240]},{"content":"In the Date field, enter a date.","pos":[1244,1276]},{"content":"In the Scrap method field, select 'Allocation'.","pos":[1280,1327]},{"content":"When you select the Allocation method, costs from the scrapped materials are added to the finished goods.","pos":[1334,1439]},{"content":"Click OK.","pos":[1445,1454]},{"pos":[1459,1487],"content":"Validate calculation results","linkify":"Validate calculation results","nodes":[{"content":"Validate calculation results","pos":[0,28]}]},{"content":"On the Action Pane, click Manage costs.","pos":[1491,1530]},{"content":"Click View cost comparison.","pos":[1534,1561]},{"content":"After you have ended the production order, you can compare the estimated cost price against the realized cost price to get an overview of the production variances.","pos":[1568,1731]}]}
