Next, you'll run two batch processes that are used to process the continuity orders.  \n14. Close the page.\n15. Go to Retail and commerce > Continuity > Process continuity payments.\n16. In the Continuity item field, type '88000' and then press the Tab key.\n17. Click OK.\n18. Go to Retail and commerce > Continuity > Create continuity child orders.\n    * This process will create new sales orders based on the settings of your continuity programs.  \n19. In the Continuity item field, type '88000' and then press the Tab key.\n    * Item '88000' is a continuity item in the USRT demo data.  \n20.
