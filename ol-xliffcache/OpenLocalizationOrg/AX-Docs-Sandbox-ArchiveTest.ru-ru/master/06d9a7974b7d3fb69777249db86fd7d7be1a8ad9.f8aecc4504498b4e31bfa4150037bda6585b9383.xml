For security reasons, we recommend that you create a web service application for each device that you use. To create a web service application in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), complete the following steps:\n\n1.  In a web browser, go to <https://manage.windowsazure.com>.\n2.  Enter the name and password for the user who has access to the Azure subscription.\n3.  In Azure Portal, in the left navigation pane, click **Active Directory**.[](./media/wh-01-active-directory-example.png)[![wh-01-active-directory-example](./media/wh-01-active-directory-example.png)](./media/wh-01-active-directory-example.png)\n4.  In the grid, select the Active Directory instance that is used by Finance and Operations.\n5.  On the top toolbar, click **Applications**. [![wh-02-active-directory-applications](./media/wh-02-active-directory-applications-1024x197.png)](./media/wh-02-active-directory-applications.png)\n6.  In the bottom pane, click **Add**. The **Add application** wizard starts.\n7.  Enter a name for the application and select **Web application and/or web API**. [![wh-03-active-directory-add-application](./media/wh-03-active-directory-add-application.png)](./media/wh-03-active-directory-add-application.png)\n8.  Enter the sign-on URL, which is your web app URL. This URL is the same as your deployment URL, but oauth is added to the end. Enter the App ID URI, this value is mandatory, but isnâ€™t required for the authentication. Make sure that this App ID URI is a mock URI like https://contosooperations/wmapp, since using the URL of your deployment can cause sign-in issues in other AAD applications such as the Excel Add-in. [![WH-04-AD-add-properties3](./media/WH-04-AD-add-properties3.png)](./media/WH-04-AD-add-properties3.png)\n9.  Go to the **Configure** tab. [![wh-05-ad-configure-app](./media/wh-05-ad-configure-app.png)](./media/wh-05-ad-configure-app.png)\n10. Scroll down until you see the **Permissions to other applications** section. Click **Add application**. [![wh-06-ad-app-add-permissions](./media/wh-06-ad-app-add-permissions.png)](./media/wh-06-ad-app-add-permissions.png)\n11. Select **Microsoft Dynamics ERP** in the list. Click the **Complete check** button in the right corner of the page. [![wh-07-ad-select-permissions](./media/wh-07-ad-select-permissions.png)](./media/wh-07-ad-select-permissions.png)\n12. In the **Delegate Permissions** list, select all the check boxes. Click **Save**. [![wh-08-ad-delegate-permissions](./media/wh-08-ad-delegate-permissions.png)](./media/wh-08-ad-delegate-permissions.png)\n13. Make a note of the following information:\n    -   **Client ID** - As you scroll up the page, you will see **Client ID** displayed.\n    -   **Key** - In the **Keys** section, create a key by selecting duration, and copy the key. This key will later be referred to as the **Client secret**.\n\n## Create and configure a user account in Finance and Operations\nTo enable Finance and Operations to use your Azure AD application, you need to complete the following configuration steps:\n\n1.  Create a new user account in Azure Active Directory for the Finance and Operations tenant. The purpose of this user account is to access the specific custom service of the warehousing app, which the Finance and Operations server exposes. After completing this step, you will have WMDP user credentials, which consist of a WMDP email address and a WMDP password. To learn about the basic steps for adding users to Azure AD and Finance and Operations, refer to this tutorial: [Sign up for a Finance and Operations subscription](/dynamics365/unified-operations/dev-itpro/dev-tools/sign-up-preview-subscription).\n2.  Create a Finance and Operations user that corresponds to the warehousing app user credentials.\n    1.  In Finance and Operations, go to **System administration** &gt; **Common** &gt; **Users**.\n    2.  Create a new user.\n    3.  Assign the Warehouse mobile device user, as shown in the following screenshot. [![wh-09-add-user-security-role](./media/wh-09-add-user-security-role.png)](./media/wh-09-add-user-security-role.png)\n\n3.  Associate your Azure Active Directory application with the warehousing app user.\n    1.  In Finance and Operations, go to **System administration** &gt; **Setup** &gt; **Azure Active Directory applications**.\n    2.  Create a new line.\n    3.  Enter the **Client ID** (obtained in the last section), give it a name, and select the previously created user. We recommend that you tag all your devices so that you can easily remove their access to Finance and Operations from this page in case they are lost. [![wh-10-ad-applications-form](./media/wh-10-ad-applications-form.png)](./media/wh-10-ad-applications-form.png)\n\n## Configure the application\nYou must configure the app on the device to connect to the Finance and Operations server through the Azure AD application. To do this, complete the following steps.\n\n1.  In the app, go to **Connection settings**.\n2.  Clear the **Demo mode** field. <br>[![wh-11-app-connection-settings-demo-mode](./media/wh-11-app-connection-settings-demo-mode-169x300.png)](./media/wh-11-app-connection-settings-demo-mode.png)\n3.  Enter the following information: \n    + **Azure Active directory client ID** - The client ID is obtained in step 13 in \"Create a web service application in Active Directory\". \n    + **Azure Active directory client secret** - The client secret is obtained in step 13 in \"Create a web service application in Active Directory\". \n    + **Azure Active directory resource** - The Azure AD directory resource depicts the Finance and Operations root URL. **Note**: Do not end this field with a forward slash character (/). \n    + **Azure Active directory tenant** - The Azure AD directory tenant used with the Finance and Operations server: https://login.windows.net/your-AD-tenant-ID. For example: https://login.windows.net/contosooperations.onmicrosoft.com. \n    <br>**Note**: Do not end this field with a forward slash character (/). \n    + **Company** - Enter the legal entity in Finance and Operations to which you want the application to connect. <br>[![wh-12-app-connection-settings](./media/wh-12-app-connection-settings-169x300.png)](./media/wh-12-app-connection-settings.png)\n4.  Select the **Back** button in the top-left corner of the application. The application will now connect to your Finance and Operations server and the log-in screen for the warehouse worker will display. <br>[![wh-13-log-in-screen](./media/wh-13-log-in-screen-180x300.png)](./media/wh-13-log-in-screen.png)\n\n## Remove access for a device\nIn case of a lost or compromised device, you must remove access to Finance and Operations for the device. The following steps describe the recommended process to remove access.\n\n1.  In Finance and Operations, go to **System administration** &gt; **Setup** &gt; **Azure Active Directory applications**.\n2.  Delete the line that corresponds to the device to which you want to remove access. Note down the **Client ID** used for the removed device.\n3.  Sign in the Azure classic portal at <https://manage.windowsazure.com>.\n4.  Click the **Active Directory** icon on the left menu, and then click the desired directory.\n5.  On the top menu, click **Applications**, and then click the application you want to configure. The **Quick Start** page will appear with single sign-on and other configuration information.\n6.  Click the **Configure** tab, scroll down and ensure that the **Client ID** of the application is the same as in step 2 in this section.\n7.  Click the **Delete** button in the command bar.\n8.  Click **Yes** in the confirmation message.\n\n\n\n\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,891],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"# required metadata\n\ntitle: Install and configure Microsoft Dynamics 365
