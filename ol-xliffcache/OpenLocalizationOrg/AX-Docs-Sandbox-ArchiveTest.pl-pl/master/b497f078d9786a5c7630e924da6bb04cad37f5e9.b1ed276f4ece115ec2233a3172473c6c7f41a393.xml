The **Is Externally Maintained** property on these Customers is set to **Yes** to track Customers that originate from Sales. During invoicing, this information is used to filter invoices that are synchronized to Sales.\n\n## Prospect to cash solution for Sales\n\nThe **Account Number** field is available on the **Account** page. It has been made a natural and unique key to support the integration. The natural key feature of the Customer Relationship Management (CRM) solution might affect customers who already use the **Account Number** field, but who don't use unique **Account Number** values per account. Currently, the integration solution doesn't support this case.\n\nWhen a new account is created, if an **Account Number** value doesn't already exist, it's automatically generated by using a number sequence. The value consists of **ACC**, followed by an increasing number sequence and then a suffix of six characters. Here is an example: **ACC-01000-BVRCPS**\n\nWhen the integration solution for Sales is applied, an upgrade script sets the **Account Number** field for existing accounts in Sales. If there are no **Account Number** values, the number sequence that was described earlier is used.\n\n## Preconditions and mapping setup\n\n- **CustomerGroupId** must be updated to a valid value in Finance and Operations. You can specify a default value, or you can set the value by using a value map. The default template value is **10**.\n- **Address country region code** is required in Finance and Operations. To avoid synchronization errors, you can specify a default value. That default value is then used if the field is left blank in Sales.\n\n    - The default template value for **AddressCountryRegionISOCode** is **USA**.\n    - The default template value for **DeliveryAddressCountryRegionISOCode** is **USA**.\n\n- By adding the following mappings from **CDS &gt; Destination**, you can help reduce the number of manual updates that are required in Finance and Operations. You can use a default value or a value map from, for example, **Country/Region** or **City**.\n\n    - **SiteId** – A site is required in order to generate quotations and sales order lines in Finance and Operations. A default site can be taken either from the product, or from the customer from the order header. The default template value for **SiteId** is **1**.\n    - **WarehouseId** – A warehouse is required in order to process quotations and sales order lines in Finance and Operations. A default warehouse can be taken either from the product, or from the customer from the order header in Finance and Operations. The default template value for **WarehouseId** is **13**.\n    - **LanguageId** – A language is required in order to generate quotations and sales orders in Finance and Operations. By default, the language from the order header from the customer is used. The default template value for **LanguageId** is **en-us**.\n\n- Update the CDS organization ID (**Organization_OrganizationId**) in the **Source &gt; CDS** mapping. The default template value is **ORG001**.\n\n## Template mapping in data integrator\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> The **Payment terms**, **Freight terms**, **Delivery terms**, **Shipping method**, and **Delivery mode** fields aren't included in the default mappings. To map these fields, you must set up a value mapping. Value mappings are specific to the data in the organizations that the entity is synchronized between.\n\nThe following illustrations show an example of a template mapping in data integrator.\n\n![Template mapping in data integrator](./media/accounts-template-mapping-data-integrator-1.png)\n\n![Template mapping for Accounts in data
