By filtering on specific products, the warehouse manager can reduce review overhead, help prevent consolidation mistakes, and save time. Typically, a warehouse manager performs the setup tasks. You can go through this procedure in the USMF demo data company or in your own data.\n\n\n## Create a cycle counting work template\n1. Go to Warehouse management > Setup > Work > Work templates.\n2.
