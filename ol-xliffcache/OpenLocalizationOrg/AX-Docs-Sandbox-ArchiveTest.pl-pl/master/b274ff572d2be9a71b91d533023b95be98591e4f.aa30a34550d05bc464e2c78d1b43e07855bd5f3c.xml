The document accompanies the shipped items, and it serves as a receipt of shipment when the items are delivered at the destination. If you're using warehouse management, there are two ways to generate a bill of lading:\n\n  -   Create the report manually, using the **Bill of lading** page.\n  -   Generate the report from the **Load planning workbench**.\n\nIf you generate the bill of lading from the **Load planning workbench**, the load status must be **Shipped.** If there's more than one shipment in the load, a bill of lading is created for each shipment. After a bill of lading has been created you can make changes to it on the **Bill of lading** page.\n\n## Master bill of lading\nIf there's more than one shipment in the load, you can generate a master bill of lading. This has the same layout and information as a bill of lading, but contains the summarized content for all the shipments. If the **Create a master bill of lading when there's more than one shipment on a load** option is set to **Yes** on the **Transportation management parameters** page, a master bill of lading is automatically generated if you create a bill of lading from the **Load planning workbench**, and there's more than one shipment. You can also get a list of the bills of lading by clicking **Related information** &gt; **Bill of lading**. If you're creating bills of lading manually, you can create a master bill of lading on the **Bill of lading** page.\n\n\n\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,732],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"#
