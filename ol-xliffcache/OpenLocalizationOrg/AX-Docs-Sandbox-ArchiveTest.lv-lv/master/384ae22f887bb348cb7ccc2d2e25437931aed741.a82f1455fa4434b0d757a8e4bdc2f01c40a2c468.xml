Closing processes prepare the system for a new period. To prepare the system for a new year, you must run the year end close process. Each organization has different processes and steps that it performs for the end of a period. Here are some optional steps for period ends:\n\n-   Complete all the tasks for all other modules, such as Accounts receivable, Accounts payable, and Inventory.\n-   Verify that all journals are posted.\n-   Run foreign currency revaluation to generate any unrealized gain or loss amounts.\n-   Settle transactions for each ledger account.\n-   Process any required allocations.\n-   Manually post period-end adjustments.\n-   Journalize transactions, and review the **Ledger journal** report.\n-   Perform a consolidation by using a consolidation company or Financial reporting.\n-   Generate period-end financial statements by using Financial reporting.\n-   Set ledger periods to **On hold**, so that no further posting occurs. You can also restrict a period to a specific user group while period-end activities are occurring, for better control. It's not a good idea to set periods to **Permanently closed**, because you can't reopen a period that has been closed.\n\nThe Financial period close workspace can be used to organize and track the tasks required for various period end processes. Refer to the [Financial period close workspace](financial-period-close-workspace.md) and [Year end close](Year-end-close.md) topics for more information. \n\n\n\n\n\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,724],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"# required metadata\n\ntitle: Close the general ledger at period end\ndescription: This topic describes the tasks that are typically completed when performing a period closing for General ledger. \nauthor: RobinARH\nmanager: AnnBe\nms.date: 06/20/2017\nms.topic: article\nms.prod: \nms.service: dynamics-ax-applications\nms.technology: \n\n# optional metadata\n\n# ms.search.form: \n# ROBOTS: \naudience: Application User\n# ms.devlang: \nms.reviewer: twheeloc\nms.search.scope: Core, AX 7.0.0, Operations, UnifiedOperations\n# ms.tgt_pltfrm: \nms.custom: 14111\nms.assetid: cec9e039-c1a2-482c-bea6-e11d896eea9d\nms.search.region: Global\n# ms.search.industry: \nms.author: aolson\nms.search.validFrom: 2016-02-28\nms.dyn365.ops.version: AX 7.0.0\n","nodes":[{"content":"Close the general ledger at period end","nodes":[{"pos":[0,38],"content":"Close the general ledger at period end","nodes":[{"content":"Close the general ledger at period end","pos":[0,38]}]}],"path":["title"],"extradata":"MT"},{"content":"This topic describes the tasks that are typically completed when performing a period closing for General ledger.","nodes":[{"pos":[0,112],"content":"This topic describes the tasks that are typically completed when performing a period closing for General ledger.","nodes":[{"content":"This topic describes the tasks that are typically completed when performing a period closing for General ledger.","pos":[0,112]}]}],"path":["description"],"extradata":"MT"}],"header":"# required metadata\n","yml":true},{"pos":[732,770],"content":"Close the general ledger at period end","linkify":"Close the general ledger at period end","nodes":[{"content":"Close the general ledger at period end","pos":[0,38]}]},{"content":"This topic describes the tasks that are typically completed when performing a period closing for General ledger.","pos":[816,928]},{"content":"In General ledger, you can complete closing procedures for a period or a year.","pos":[931,1009]},{"content":"Closing processes prepare the system for a new period.","pos":[1010,1064]},{"content":"To prepare the system for a new year, you must run the year end close process.","pos":[1065,1143]},{"content":"Each organization has different processes and steps that it performs for the end of a period.","pos":[1144,1237]},{"content":"Here are some optional steps for period ends:","pos":[1238,1283]},{"content":"Complete all the tasks for all other modules, such as Accounts receivable, Accounts payable, and Inventory.","pos":[1289,1396]},{"content":"Verify that all journals are posted.","pos":[1401,1437]},{"content":"Run foreign currency revaluation to generate any unrealized gain or loss amounts.","pos":[1442,1523]},{"content":"Settle transactions for each ledger account.","pos":[1528,1572]},{"content":"Process any required allocations.","pos":[1577,1610]},{"content":"Manually post period-end adjustments.","pos":[1615,1652]},{"pos":[1657,1723],"content":"Journalize transactions, and review the <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Ledger journal<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> report.","source":"Journalize transactions, and review the **Ledger journal** report."},{"content":"Perform a consolidation by using a consolidation company or Financial reporting.","pos":[1728,1808]},{"content":"Generate period-end financial statements by using Financial reporting.","pos":[1813,1883]},{"content":"Set ledger periods to <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>On hold<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept>, so that no further posting occurs.","pos":[1888,1957],"source":"Set ledger periods to **On hold**, so that no further posting occurs."},{"content":"You can also restrict a period to a specific user group while period-end activities are occurring, for better control.","pos":[1958,2076]},{"content":"It's not a good idea to set periods to <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Permanently closed<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept>, because you can't reopen a period that has been closed.","pos":[2077,2195],"source":" It's not a good idea to set periods to **Permanently closed**, because you can't reopen a period that has been closed."},{"content":"The Financial period close workspace can be used to organize and track the tasks required for various period end processes.","pos":[2197,2320]},{"content":"Refer to the <bpt id=\"p1\">[</bpt>Financial period close workspace<ept id=\"p1\">](financial-period-close-workspace.md)</ept> and <bpt id=\"p2\">[</bpt>Year end close<ept id=\"p2\">](Year-end-close.md)</ept> topics for more information.","pos":[2321,2474],"source":" Refer to the [Financial period close workspace](financial-period-close-workspace.md) and [Year end close](Year-end-close.md) topics for more information."}]}
