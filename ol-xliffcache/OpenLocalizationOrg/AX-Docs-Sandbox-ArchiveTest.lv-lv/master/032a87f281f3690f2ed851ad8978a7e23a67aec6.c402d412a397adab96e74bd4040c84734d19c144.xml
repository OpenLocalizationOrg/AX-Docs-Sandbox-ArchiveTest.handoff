This functionality applies only to legal entities in Latvia. Tax must also be calculated on imported or self-produced goods that are used internally. Finally, tax on natural resources must be calculated for packaging materials that are used to package goods that are sold within the reporting period.\n\n## Prerequisites\n| Prerequisite                                                   | More information                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Set up a tax authority.                                        |    |\n| Set up the ledger posting group for the Natural resources tax. |  |\n| Set up a settlement period for the Natural resources tax.      |  |\n| Set up sales tax codes for the Natural resources tax.          | |\n| Set up sales tax groups for the Natural resources tax.         |  |\n| Set up tax groups for the Natural resources tax.               | Use the **Natural resources tax group** page to set up tax groups that define the correct sales tax codes, based on the intersection of the tax group and sales tax group for the Natural resources tax.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n| Set up inventory parameters.                                   | On the **Inventory and warehouse management parameters** page, set the **Calculate packing material fees** option to **Yes**. In the **Sales tax group** field, select a sales tax group for the Natural resources tax. By default, this sales tax group is used to find the sales tax code that is used for report calculations if a transaction that is transferred to the report has no sales tax group. |\n| Specify natural resources tax information for an item.         | In Product information management, on the **Released products** page, on the **Manage inventory** tab, in the **Natural resource tax group** field, specify a value to calculate the Natural resources tax for an item in a sale or in inventory transactions.                                                                                                                                              |\n\n## Report setup\nBefore you can generate the **Natural resources tax** report, you must set up the lines for each report layout. Repeat the following steps for every line in each report layout.\n\n1.  Click **Tax** &gt; **Setup** &gt; **Sales tax** &gt; **Natural resources tax report setup**.\n2.  Click **New**.\n3.  In the **Form number** field, select the form to set up:\n    -   **Form 2** – This form shows information about the use of natural resources and any environmental pollution that is generated within the reporting period.\n    -   **Form 3** – This form shows information about the tax on natural resources that is calculated for goods that were imported or produced by the company and sold in Latvia for the first time.\n\n4.  Select a sequence number. This number specifies the position of the line in the sequence of lines on the report.\n5.  In the **Line type** field, select the type of report line:\n    -   **Header** – The line is printed as header lines on report pages.\n    -   **Line**\n    -   **Total** – The line shows the summarized line values.\n\n6.  If you selected **Line** in step 5, enter the line code for the **Natural resources tax** report line.\n7.  In the **Description** field, enter a brief description of the transaction.\n8.  In the **Total line code** field, enter the total line code. If you selected **Line** in step 5, the **Warehouse** field shows the warehouse code.\n9.  In the **Sales tax code** field, select the sales tax code that was created for the calculation of the Natural resources tax.\n10. In the **Packing material code** field, select the packing material code that was created for the Natural resources tax. This field isn't available if you select a sales tax code in the **Sales tax code** field. Only one of these two fields is available at a time.\n\n### Example: Form 2 layout\n\nThis example layout has the following information elements:\n\n-   A header that introduces the content of the report\n-   Lines that show the descriptions and individual values to report\n-   The total amounts for the line values\n\n| Form number | Line type | Sequence number | Line code | Description                                | Total line code | Location Id | Natural resources Tax code | Packing material code |\n|-------------|-----------|-----------------|-----------|--------------------------------------------|-----------------|-------------|----------------------------|-----------------------|\n| Form 2      | Header    | 1               |           | I.
