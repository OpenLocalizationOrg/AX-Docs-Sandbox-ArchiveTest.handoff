You cannot use system grouping to filter on line level fields.\n\n## Set up system grouping on an open work list\nUse these steps to set up system grouping on an open work list.\n\n-   From a mobile device menu item, select **Mode: Indirect** and **Activity Code: Display open work list**. The following options become available. These options are required for system grouping on an open work list. \n\n| Option        | Description   | \n| ------------- | ------------- |\n| Allow system grouping   | Enables system groping for a selected work list menu item.| \n| System grouping field   | Available only if **Allow system work** is set to **Yes**. Select the field that determines how picking work will be grouped for workers. For example, if you select the **ShipmentId** field, the worker will scan the shipment ID to group the picking work. All work for the shipment is then assigned to the worker. This field requires that you create a menu item to use existing work that is grouped by the system. Use the **System grouping label** field to inform the worker what to scan. |\n| System grouping label   | Available only if **Allow system work** is set to **Yes**. Enter information for the worker about what to scan when picking work is grouped. For example, if you use the **ShipmentId** field to group picking work by shipment, you might enter Shipment ID in the field. This field requires that you create a menu item to use existing work that is grouped by the system. You must also select the field to group by in the **System grouping** field.|\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,632],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"# required metadata\n\ntitle: System grouping on
