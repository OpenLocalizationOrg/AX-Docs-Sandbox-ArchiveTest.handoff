This parameter applies to ledger journal transactions. This parameter is used only when the journal allows one voucher number, and when the **Validation on bill of exchange journals** option is selected on the **Accounts receivable parameters** page. The **Validation on bill of exchange journal** parameter affects the following documents:\n\n-   Draw bill of exchange journal\n-   Remittance journal\n-   Protest bill of exchange journal\n-   Redraw bill of exchange journal\n-   Settle bill of exchange journal\n-   Payment journal\n\n## Dates in bill of exchange journals\nIf the **Date treatment on bill of exchange journal** parameter is set to **Yes**, the transaction date on bill of exchange journals is updated to the due date when a payment proposal is used. The **Date treatment on bill of exchange journal** parameter affects the following documents:\n\n-   Remittance journal\n-   Protest bill of exchange journal\n-   Redraw bill of exchange journal\n\n\n\n\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,752],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"# required metadata\n\ntitle: Spanish bill of exchange options\ndescription: This topic describes specific options and changes in basic bill of exchange process implemented in Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, Enterprise edition for legal entities in Spain.\nauthor: ShylaThompson\nmanager: AnnBe\nms.date: 06/20/2017\nms.topic: article\nms.prod: \nms.service: dynamics-ax-applications\nms.technology: \n\n# optional metadata\n\n# ms.search.form: \n# ROBOTS: \naudience: Application User\n# ms.devlang: \nms.reviewer: shylaw\nms.search.scope: Core, Operations, UnifiedOperations\n# ms.tgt_pltfrm: \nms.custom: 264644\nms.search.region: Spain\n# ms.search.industry: \nms.author: v-elgolu\nms.search.validFrom: 2016-11-30\nms.dyn365.ops.version: Version 1611\n","nodes":[{"content":"Spanish bill of exchange options","nodes":[{"pos":[0,32],"content":"Spanish bill of exchange options","nodes":[{"content":"Spanish bill of exchange options","pos":[0,32]}]}],"path":["title"],"extradata":"MT"},{"content":"This topic describes specific options and changes in basic bill of exchange process implemented in Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, Enterprise edition for legal entities in Spain.","nodes":[{"pos":[0,197],"content":"This topic describes specific options and changes in basic bill of exchange process implemented in Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, Enterprise edition for legal entities in Spain.","nodes":[{"content":"This topic describes specific options and changes in basic bill of exchange process implemented in Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, Enterprise edition for legal entities in Spain.","pos":[0,197]}]}],"path":["description"],"extradata":"MT"}],"header":"# required metadata\n","yml":true},{"pos":[760,792],"content":"Spanish bill of exchange options","linkify":"Spanish bill of exchange options","nodes":[{"content":"Spanish bill of exchange options","pos":[0,32]}]},{"content":"This topic describes specific options and changes in basic bill of exchange process implemented in Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, Enterprise edition for legal entities in Spain.","pos":[838,1035]},{"content":"For legal entities in Spain, the bill of exchange functionality has additional options:","pos":[1037,1124]},{"content":"Validation for bill of exchange journals","pos":[1130,1170]},{"content":"Dates in bill of exchange journals","pos":[1175,1209]},{"pos":[1214,1274],"content":"Accounts receivable parameters for Spanish bills of exchange","linkify":"Accounts receivable parameters for Spanish bills of exchange","nodes":[{"content":"Accounts receivable parameters for Spanish bills of exchange","pos":[0,60]}]},{"pos":[1275,1421],"content":"To set up the parameters for bills of exchange for legal entities in Spain, go to <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Accounts receivable parameters<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> <ph id=\"ph1\">&amp;gt;</ph> <bpt id=\"p2\">**</bpt>Bill of exchange ES<ept id=\"p2\">**</ept>.","source":"To set up the parameters for bills of exchange for legal entities in Spain, go to **Accounts receivable parameters** &gt;
