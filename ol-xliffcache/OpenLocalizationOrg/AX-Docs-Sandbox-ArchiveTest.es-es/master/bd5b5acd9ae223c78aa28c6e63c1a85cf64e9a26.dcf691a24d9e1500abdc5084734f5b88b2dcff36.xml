Configuration rules define relationships between items in a bill of materials (BOM) for products that use the dimension-based configuration technology.\n\nConfiguration rules are available when you define dimension-based configuration models. Configuration rules are used to either enforce or prohibit specific item combinations in a bill of materials (BOM). After a BOM has been created and the relevant items have been assigned to their respective configuration groups, one or more configuration rules can be defined. If two items belong together, the **Select** operator is used to ensure inclusion. If two items are mutually exclusive, the **Deselect** operator is used to ensure exclusion.  \n\n**Note:** This information applies only to product masters that use the dimension-based configuration technology.  \n\nExisting configurations aren't affected by subsequent changes to the configuration rules. However, it's important that you set the rules before you define a new configuration, and that you check the rules if you think they have been changed.  \n\n**Note:** For the **Select** method, the derived configuration group, item number, and configuration are automatically selected. For the **Deselect** method, the derived configuration group, item number, and configuration can't be selected.\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n[Dimension-based product configuration](dimension-based-product-configuration.md)\n\n\n\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,823],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"# required metadata\n\ntitle: Configuration rules\ndescription: This article provides general information about configuration rules.
