The guide uses the USMF demo company.\n\n\n## Create an entity backed financial dimension\n1. Go to General ledger > Chart of accounts > Dimensions > Financial dimensions.\n2. Click New.\n3. In the User values from field, select a system-defined entity to base the financial dimension on. \n4. In the Dimension name field, type a value to describe the financial dimension.\n    * The name can be different than the system-defined entity but cannot contain spaces or special characters.  \n5. Click Activate.\n    * Activating the financial dimension updates the table with the financial dimension name and removes deleted dimensions. You can enter dimension values before you activate a financial dimension, but a financial dimension cannot be used until it is activated.  \n6. Click Close on the activation message.\n7. Click Activate.\n    * Dimension activation can be scheduled to run by batch at a specific date and time.  \n8. Click Dimension values.\n    * Some dimension values are company specific. You can verify if they are company specific by if the company name is showing in the dimension values list.  \n\n## Create a custom financial dimension\n1. Close the page.\n2. Click New.\n3. In the Use values from field, select <Custom dimension>.\n4. In the Dimension name field, type a value to describe the financial dimension.\n    * The name cannot contain spaces or special characters.  \n    * You can also specify an account mask to limit the amount and type of information that you can enter for dimension values.   \n    * You can enter characters that remain the same for each dimension value, such as letters or a hyphen. You can also enter number signs (#) and ampersands (&) as placeholders for letters and numbers that will change every time that a dimension value is created. Use a number sign (#) as a placeholder for a number and an ampersand (&) as a placeholder for a letter.  Example: To limit the dimension value to the letters CC and three numbers, you enter CC-### as the format mask.  \n5. Click Activate.\n    * Activating the financial dimension updates the table with the financial dimension name and removes deleted dimensions. You can enter dimension values before you activate a financial dimension, but a financial dimension cannot be used until it is activated.  \n6. Click Activate.\n    * Dimension activation can be scheduled to run by batch at a specific date and time.  \n7. Click Dimension values.\n8. Click New.\n9. In the Dimension value field, type a name to describe your financial dimension value.\n10. In the Description field, type a description that describes your financial dimension value.\n\n","nodes":[{"pos":[5,644],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"# required metadata \n \ntitle: Define financial dimensions\ndescription: This task guide demonstrates adding an entity backed financial dimension and a custom financial dimension. \nauthor: aprilolson\nmanager: AnnBe \nms.date: 11/14/2016\nms.topic: business-process \nms.prod:  \nms.service: dynamics-ax-applications \nms.technology:  \n \n# optional metadata \n \n# ms.search.form:   \naudience: Application User \n# ms.devlang:  \nms.reviewer: twheeloc\nms.search.scope: Operations \n# ms.tgt_pltfrm:  \n# ms.custom:  \nms.search.region: Global\n# ms.search.industry: \nms.author: aolson\nms.search.validFrom: 2016-06-30 \nms.dyn365.ops.version: Version 7.0.0 ","nodes":[{"content":"Define financial dimensions","nodes":[{"pos":[0,27],"content":"Define financial dimensions","nodes":[{"content":"Define financial dimensions","pos":[0,27]}]}],"path":["title"],"extradata":"MT"},{"content":"This task guide demonstrates adding an entity backed financial dimension and a custom financial dimension.","nodes":[{"pos":[0,106],"content":"This task guide demonstrates adding an entity backed financial dimension and a custom financial dimension.","nodes":[{"content":"This task guide demonstrates adding an entity backed financial dimension and a custom financial dimension.","pos":[0,106]}]}],"path":["description"],"extradata":"MT"}],"header":"# required metadata \n","yml":true},{"pos":[651,678],"content":"Define financial dimensions","linkify":"Define financial dimensions","nodes":[{"content":"Define financial dimensions","pos":[0,27]}]},{"content":"This task guide demonstrates adding an entity backed financial dimension and a custom financial dimension.","pos":[748,854]},{"content":"The guide uses the USMF demo company.","pos":[856,893]},{"pos":[899,942],"content":"Create an entity backed financial dimension","linkify":"Create an entity backed financial dimension","nodes":[{"content":"Create an entity backed financial dimension","pos":[0,43]}]},{"content":"Go to General ledger &gt;
