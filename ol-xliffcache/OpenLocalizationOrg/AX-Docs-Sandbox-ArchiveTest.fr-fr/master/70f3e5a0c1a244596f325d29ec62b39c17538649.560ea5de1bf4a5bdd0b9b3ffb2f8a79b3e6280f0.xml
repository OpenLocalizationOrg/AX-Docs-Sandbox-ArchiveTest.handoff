You can then open or modify a report. To open one of the default reports, select the report name. The first time that a report is opened, it's automatically generated for the previous month. For example, if you open a report for the first time in August 2016, the report is generated for July 31, 2016. After a report is opened, you can start exploring it by drilling down on specific pieces of data and changing report options.\n\n## Creating and modifying financial reports\nFrom the financial reports list, you can create a new report or modify an existing report. If you have the appropriate permissions, you can create a new financial report by clicking **New** on the Action Pane. A report designer program is downloaded to your device. After the report designer starts you can then create the new report. After you save the new report, it appears in the financial reports list. The list shows only reports that were created for the company that you're using in Finance and Operations. For more information about the process of creating and modifying financial reports in Finance and Operations, refer to these [blog posts](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dynamics_financial_reporting/tag/learning/) from the Dynamics financial reporting blog. **Note:** The computer that you are downloading the report designer client on must have version 4.6.2 of the Microsoft .NET Framework installed on it. This version of the Microsoft .NET Framework can be downloaded and installed from [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=53345). If you are using Chrome, you must install a ClickOnce extension in order to download the report designer client. If you are running in incognito mode, make sure the ClickOnce extension is enabled for incognito mode. You can also modify a report that appears in the financial reports list. When the area around the report name is selected, click **Edit** on the Action Pane. The report designer program starts.\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n[View financial reports](view-financial-reports.md)\n\n[Dynamics Financial Reporting blog](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/dynamics_financial_reporting/)\n\n\n\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,864],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"# required metadata\n\ntitle: Financial reporting\ndescription: This topic describes where to access financial reporting in Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, Enterprise edition and how to use the financial reporting capabilities.
