          <source>If you reverse the status of a production order, the order and all operations that are associated with the routes revert to a previous step in the production life cycle.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="106" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>For example, a production order has a status of <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Scheduled<ept id="p1">**</ept>, and you change the status back to <bpt id="p2">**</bpt>Created<ept id="p2">**</ept>.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="107" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>In this case, the system must first change the status to <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Estimated<ept id="p1">**</ept>, which is the status that immediately precedes <bpt id="p2">**</bpt>Scheduled<ept id="p2">**</ept>.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="108" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>It can then change the status to the status that you want, <bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Created<ept id="p1">**</ept>.</source>

          <source><bpt id="p1">**</bpt>Note:<ept id="p1">**</ept> If your order has reached the <bpt id="p2">**</bpt>Report as finished<ept id="p2">**</ept> status, you can still reverse it to an earlier status.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="110" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>However, you must re-run estimation and operations scheduling, job scheduling, or both types of scheduling, to update the information on the order.</source>

        <trans-unit id="111" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>This step is required, because any reservations of remaining item consumption and operations resource consumption must also be reset.</source>
