The demo data company used to create this procedure is USMF. It is a prerequisite that you have created a product master with the dimension-based configuration technology. This is the second procedure out of eight which explains how to build combinations for dimension-based configuration.\n\n1. Go to Product information management > Products > Product masters.\n    * Filter the Configuration technology column so that only the dimension-based configuration is displayed. For example, you can filter the column by typing Dimension.    \n2. In the list, mark the selected row.\n3. Click Release products.\n4. Click Next.\n    * For products that are crated with the dimension-based configuration technology, the product variants must be created in the company where the bill of materials will be created.  \n5. Click Next.\n6. In the list, find and select the desired record.\n    * Select the company USMF for this procedure.  \n7. Click Next.\n8.
