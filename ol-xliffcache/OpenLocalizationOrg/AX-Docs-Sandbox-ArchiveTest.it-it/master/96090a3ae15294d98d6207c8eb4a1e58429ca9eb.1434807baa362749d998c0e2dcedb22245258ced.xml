A report definition is a report component (or building block) that uses a row definition, a column definition, and an optional reporting tree definition to create a report. A report definition also provides options and settings that for customizing a report. \n\nA report definition is a report component (or building block) that uses a row definition, a column definition, and an optional reporting tree definition to create a report. A report definition also provides options and settings that you can use to customize a report. After you define row definitions and column definitions, you must combine them in a report definition. At this point, you also define other aspects of the definitions, such as the detail level and report date. You can then save and generate a report. Financial reporting offers the following levels of detail:\n\n-   Financial\n-   Financial and Account\n-   Financial, Account, and Transaction\n\nHowever, depending on how data is stored in the Microsoft Dynamics ERP system, transaction details might not be available in reports.\n\n## Create a report definition\n1.  In Report Designer, on the **File** menu, click **New**, and then select **Report Definition**.\n2.  Specify the appropriate information on the **Report**, **Output and Distribution**, **Headers and Footers**, and **Settings** tabs.\n\n## Contents of a report definition\nThe following table describes the tabs in a report definition and how the information is used.\n\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"header\">\n<th>Tab</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td>Report</td>\n<td>Create a report, configure a report, or modify an existing report.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td>Output and Distribution</td>\n<td>Change the output type and destination of the report.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td>Headers and Footers</td>\n<td>Define and format the headers and footers for the report.
