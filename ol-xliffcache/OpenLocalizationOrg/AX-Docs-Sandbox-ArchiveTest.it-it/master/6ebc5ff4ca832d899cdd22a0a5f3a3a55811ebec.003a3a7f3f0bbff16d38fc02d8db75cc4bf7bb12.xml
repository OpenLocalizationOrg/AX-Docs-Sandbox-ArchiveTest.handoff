This step must be completed for each legal entity that you use for retail. To initialize the retail configuration, follow these steps.\n\n1.  Start the Dynamics 365 for Retail client.\n2.  Click **Retail** &gt; **Headquarters setup** &gt; **Parameters** &gt; **Retail parameters**.\n3.  Click **Initialize**.\n\nInitialization creates the following default configuration data:\n\n-   Retail scheduler jobs and subjobs\n-   Retail channel schema\n-   Retail distribution schedules\n-   Default screen layouts, which include button grids, images, and themes\n-   Time zone information\n-   Point-of-sale (POS) operations\n-   POS permissions\n-   Channel reports\n-   Attribute metadata\n-   Entity validation templates\n-   Batch job to purge Commerce Data Exchange session history\n\nAdditionally, logging that is related to the payment card industry (PCI) is enabled for the Dynamics 365 for Retail database. **Note:** There is an option to separately configure the Retail scheduler. This option lets you reset the Retail scheduler configuration to its default settings. After initialization is completed, you must configure additional retail data. Here are some examples:\n\n-   Retail parameters\n-   Retail scheduler parameters\n-   Retail channels\n-   Registers and devices\n-   Assortments\n\n\n\n\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,771],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"# required metadata\n\ntitle: Initialize seed data in a new Retail environment\ndescription: This article describes the data that's created as part of the initialization process for Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Retail.\nauthor: josaw1\nmanager: AnnBe\nms.date: 06/20/2017\nms.topic: article\nms.prod: \nms.service: dynamics-365-retail\nms.technology: \n\n# optional metadata\n\n# ms.search.form: \n# ROBOTS: \naudience: Application User\n# ms.devlang: \nms.reviewer: annbe\nms.search.scope: Core, AX 7.0.0, Operations, UnifiedOperations, Retail\n# ms.tgt_pltfrm: \nms.custom: 49621\nms.assetid: 4dc762eb-190e-4485-8f55-b0cafc81bc37\nms.search.region: global\nms.search.industry: Retail\nms.author: josaw\nms.search.validFrom: 2016-02-28\nms.dyn365.ops.version: AX 7.0.0, Retail July 2017 update\n\n","nodes":[{"content":"Initialize seed data in a new Retail environment","nodes":[{"pos":[0,48],"content":"Initialize seed data in a new Retail environment","nodes":[{"content":"Initialize seed data in a new Retail environment","pos":[0,48]}]}],"path":["title"],"extradata":"MT"},{"content":"This article describes the data that's created as part of the initialization process for Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Retail.","nodes":[{"pos":[0,123],"content":"This article describes the data that's created as part of the initialization process for Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Retail.","nodes":[{"content":"This article describes the data that's created as part of the initialization process for Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Retail.","pos":[0,123]}]}],"path":["description"],"extradata":"MT"}],"header":"# required metadata\n","yml":true},{"pos":[779,827],"content":"Initialize seed data in a new Retail environment","linkify":"Initialize seed data in a new Retail environment","nodes":[{"content":"Initialize seed data in a new Retail environment","pos":[0,48]}]},{"content":"This article describes the data that's created as part of the initialization process for Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Retail.","pos":[870,993]},{"content":"After the Retail solution has been deployed through Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services (LCS), you must initialize the retail configuration to create the basic configuration data.","pos":[995,1176]},{"content":"<bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Important:<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> Before you initialize the retail configuration, make sure that you've specified a language and a postal address for each legal entity where you will set up retail stores.","pos":[1177,1362],"source":"**Important:** Before you initialize the retail configuration, make sure that you've specified a language and a postal address for each legal entity where you will set up retail stores."},{"content":"This step must be completed for each legal entity that you use for retail.","pos":[1363,1437]},{"content":"To initialize the retail configuration, follow these steps.","pos":[1438,1497]},{"content":"Start the Dynamics 365 for Retail client.","pos":[1503,1544]},{"pos":[1549,1641],"content":"Click <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Retail<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> <ph id=\"ph1\">&amp;gt;</ph> <bpt id=\"p2\">**</bpt>Headquarters setup<ept id=\"p2\">**</ept> <ph id=\"ph2\">&amp;gt;</ph> <bpt id=\"p3\">**</bpt>Parameters<ept id=\"p3\">**</ept> <ph id=\"ph3\">&amp;gt;</ph> <bpt id=\"p4\">**</bpt>Retail parameters<ept id=\"p4\">**</ept>.","source":"Click **Retail** &gt;
