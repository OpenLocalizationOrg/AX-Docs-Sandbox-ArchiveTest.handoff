When you transfer fixed assets between funds, if the fund dimension requires balanced entries, the transfer-from and transfer-to account fields on the asset transfer page are required. \n\n> [!NOTE] \n> This is not a property of fixed assets or of funds. Rather, it’s a property of the financial dimension. When you transfer a fixed asset, if any financial dimension associated with the asset requires balanced entries, the transfer-from and transfer-to accounts are required. \n\nThe transfer-from and transfer-to accounts are not the accounts in which the fixed asset’s net book value is held. Rather, the transfer-from and transfer-to accounts are the main accounts used to balance entries in financial dimensions. They are used only when a financial dimension for the fixed asset requires balancing. The transfer-from account will have a debit entry, and the transfer-to account will have a credit entry.\n\nFor details, see [Funds in the public sector](funds-public-sector.md).\n\n\n\n\n\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,721],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"# required metadata\n\ntitle: Fixed assets in the public sector\ndescription: This article describes the fixed assets functionality that is available for public sector. \nauthor: twheeloc\nmanager: AnnBe\nms.date: 06/20/2017\nms.topic: article\nms.prod: \nms.service: dynamics-ax-applications\nms.technology: \n\n# optional metadata\n\nms.search.form: AssetTransfer\n# ROBOTS: \naudience: Application User\n# ms.devlang: \nms.reviewer: twheeloc\nms.search.scope: Core, AX 7.0.0, Operations, UnifiedOperations\n# ms.tgt_pltfrm: \nms.custom: 20891\nms.assetid: 552c7969-f044-4774-82ec-080aeae8cf3f\nms.search.region: Global\nms.search.industry: Public sector\nms.author: brpotter\nms.search.validFrom: 2016-02-28\nms.dyn365.ops.version: AX 7.0.0\n","nodes":[{"content":"Fixed assets in the public sector","nodes":[{"pos":[0,33],"content":"Fixed assets in the public sector","nodes":[{"content":"Fixed assets in the public sector","pos":[0,33]}]}],"path":["title"],"extradata":"MT"},{"content":"This article describes the fixed assets functionality that is available for public sector.","nodes":[{"pos":[0,90],"content":"This article describes the fixed assets functionality that is available for public sector.","nodes":[{"content":"This article describes the fixed assets functionality that is available for public sector.","pos":[0,90]}]}],"path":["description"],"extradata":"MT"}],"header":"# required metadata\n","yml":true},{"pos":[729,762],"content":"Fixed assets in the public sector","linkify":"Fixed assets in the public sector","nodes":[{"content":"Fixed assets in the public sector","pos":[0,33]}]},{"content":"This article describes the fixed assets functionality that is available for public sector.","pos":[808,898]},{"pos":[901,956],"content":"What do I need to know about disposing of fixed assets?","linkify":"What do I need to know about disposing of fixed assets?","nodes":[{"content":"What do I need to know about disposing of fixed assets?","pos":[0,55]}]},{"content":"Public sector organizations can use scrap and sales proposals to dispose of more than one fixed asset at a time.","pos":[1014,1126]},{"pos":[1131,1236],"content":"Why do I have to enter transfer-from and transfer-to accounts when I transfer fixed assets between funds?","linkify":"Why do I have to enter transfer-from and transfer-to accounts when I transfer fixed assets between funds?","nodes":[{"content":"Why do I have to enter transfer-from and transfer-to accounts when I transfer fixed assets between funds?","pos":[0,105]}]},{"content":"Public sector organizations typically require balanced entries for the financial dimension used to designate funds.","pos":[1237,1352]},{"content":"When you transfer fixed assets between funds, if the fund dimension requires balanced entries, the transfer-from and transfer-to account fields on the asset transfer page are required.","pos":[1353,1537]},{"pos":[1542,1826],"content":"[!NOTE] \nThis is not a property of fixed assets or of funds.
