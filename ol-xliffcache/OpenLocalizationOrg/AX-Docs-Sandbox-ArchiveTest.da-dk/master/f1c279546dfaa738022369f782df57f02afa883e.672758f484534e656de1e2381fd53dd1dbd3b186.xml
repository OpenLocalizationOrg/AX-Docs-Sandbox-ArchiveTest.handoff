You can also configure the vendor invoice workflow to run vendor invoice policies every time that you submit an invoice to workflow. \n\nVendor invoice policies do not apply to invoices that were created in the invoice register or invoice journal. \n\nInvoice matching validation does not use vendor invoice policies, but is instead set up in the Accounts payable parameters page.\n\nThis recording uses the USMF demo company. The accounts payable manager or accounting manager role would perform these steps. Before you begin, make sure that the Invoice matching configuration key is selected.\n\n\n## Prepare to create vendor invoice policies\n1.
