Ideally this feature is used in scenarios in which a file automatically maps to the system and user does not need to go through advanced mapping or create repeated import or export jobs.\n\n-   This feature supports working with both out-of-the-box and custom entities.\n-   You can import from files, and if you are using an ODBC data source, you can select a query to use to define your import.\n-   You must have previously defined source data formats for either AX or File, and know where they are located.\n-   You do not need to create a processing group to use quick import/export, one will be automatically created by the system when executing the import or export job. You can also choose keep the history of the data imported by the quick import/export.\n\n  Note that Quick import export assumes that you are familiar with the concepts of DIXF.\n\n\n\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,659],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"# required metadata\n\ntitle: Use quick import/export\ndescription: The purpose of Quick import export is to let you import and export with fewer steps.\nauthor: margoc\nmanager: AnnBe\nms.date: 06/20/2017\nms.topic: article\nms.prod: dynamics-ax-2012 \nms.service:\nms.technology: ax-2012\n\n# optional metadata\n\n# ms.search.form: \n# ROBOTS: \naudience: Application User\n# ms.devlang: \nms.reviewer: margoc\nms.search.scope: AX 2012 R3 CU8, UnifiedOperations\n# ms.tgt_pltfrm: \nms.custom: 89041\nms.assetid: 990d64e6-d436-4c79-9bb5-bf8c5c5a048f\nms.search.region: Global\n# ms.search.industry: \nms.author: margoc\nms.search.validFrom: \nms.dyn365.ops.version: AX 2012 R3 CU8\n","nodes":[{"content":"Use quick import/export","nodes":[{"pos":[0,23],"content":"Use quick import/export","nodes":[{"content":"Use quick import/export","pos":[0,23]}]}],"path":["title"],"extradata":"MT"},{"content":"The purpose of Quick import export is to let you import and export with fewer steps.","nodes":[{"pos":[0,84],"content":"The purpose of Quick import export is to let you import and export with fewer steps.","nodes":[{"content":"The purpose of Quick import export is to let you import and export with fewer steps.","pos":[0,84]}]}],"path":["description"],"extradata":"MT"}],"header":"# required metadata\n","yml":true},{"pos":[667,731],"content":"Run the Test Data Transfer Tool (beta) for Dynamics AX (AX 2012)","linkify":"Run the Test Data Transfer Tool (beta) for Dynamics AX (AX 2012)","nodes":[{"content":"Run the Test Data Transfer Tool (beta) for Dynamics AX (AX 2012)","pos":[0,64]}]},{"content":"The purpose of Quick import export is to let you import and export with fewer steps.","pos":[780,864]},{"content":"We added the Quick Import Export feature to let users import or export simple jobs that they want to execute quickly.","pos":[866,983]},{"content":"Ideally this feature is used in scenarios in which a file automatically maps to the system and user does not need to go through advanced mapping or create repeated import or export jobs.","pos":[984,1170]},{"content":"This feature supports working with both out-of-the-box and custom entities.","pos":[1176,1251]},{"content":"You can import from files, and if you are using an ODBC data source, you can select a query to use to define your import.","pos":[1256,1377]},{"content":"You must have previously defined source data formats for either AX or File, and know where they are located.","pos":[1382,1490]},{"content":"You do not need to create a processing group to use quick import/export, one will be automatically created by the system when executing the import or export job.","pos":[1495,1656]},{"content":"You can also choose keep the history of the data imported by the quick import/export.","pos":[1657,1742]},{"content":"Note that Quick import export assumes that you are familiar with the concepts of DIXF.","pos":[1746,1832]}]}
