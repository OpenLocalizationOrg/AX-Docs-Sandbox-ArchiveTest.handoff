This procedure shows how to create cost elements by importing main accounts via a data connector. The USMF demo company was used to create this procedure. This procedure is for a Cost accounting feature that was added in Dynamics 365 for Operations, version 1611.\n\n\n## Create new cost elements\n1. Go to Cost accounting > Dimensions > Cost element dimensions.\n2. Click New.\n3. In the Name field, type a value.\n4. In the Data connector for dimension members field, enter or select a value.\n5. In the Description field, type a value.\n6. Click Save.\n\n## Configure the data connector\n1. Click Configure dimension member provider.\n2. In the Chart of accounts field, enter or select a value.\n    * Select Shared to use the shared chart of accounts.  \n3. Click New.\n4. In the list, mark the selected row.\n    * You can apply filters to accounts to meet your criteria.  \n5. In the From main account field, enter or select a value.\n6.
