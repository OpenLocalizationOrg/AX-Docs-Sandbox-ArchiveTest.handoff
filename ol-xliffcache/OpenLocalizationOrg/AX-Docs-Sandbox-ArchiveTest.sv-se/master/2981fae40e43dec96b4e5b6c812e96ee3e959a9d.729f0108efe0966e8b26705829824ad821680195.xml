When you set up a method of payment for a customer or vendor, you indicate which file formats and standards should be used for payments and how payments will be processed. You can select from the following types of formats:\n\n-   Export\n-   Import\n-   Return\n-   Remittance\n\n### Method 1: Electronic reporting file formats\n\nFor file formats that are based on ER configurations, you must import the configurations from Lifecycle Services (LCS). For more information, see [Download Electronic reporting configurations from Lifecycle Services](/dynamics365/unified-operations/dev-itpro/analytics/download-electronic-reporting-configuration-lcs). After you import reporting configurations for those file formats, the imported formats will be available to select on the **Methods of payment** page. The process for importing and selecting file formats for Europe is similar to the procedure for Japan. For more details, see [Enable the JBA payment file format](/dynamics365/unified-operations/financials/localizations/tasks/jba-payment-file-format)\n\n### Method 2: X++ file formats\n\nTo select file formats that are based on X++ code, complete the following steps.\n\n1.  Go to the **Methods of payment** page.\n2.  On the **File formats** FastTab, click **Setup**.\n3.  Select the tab that corresponds with the file format type.\n4.  Select a file format from the **Available** list and move it to the **Selected** list with the arrow control.\n5.  Close the **File formats for methods of payment** page.\n6.  On the **File formats** FastTab, select the file format to use for the method of payment from the appropriate file format field. The General electronic reporting options should be set to **No** for X++ file formats.\n\n\n\n\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,739],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"# required metadata\n\ntitle:
