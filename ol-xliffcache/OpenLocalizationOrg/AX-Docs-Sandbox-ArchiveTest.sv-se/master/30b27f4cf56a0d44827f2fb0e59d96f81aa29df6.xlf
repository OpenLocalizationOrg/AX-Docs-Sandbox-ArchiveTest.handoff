        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="259" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>You can use just departments as a dimension.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="260" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>However, you must use both cost centers and departments as dimensions in the account structure if cost centers are used only as cost accumulators, and departments are used for revenue recognition.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="261" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
          <source>Model multiple hierarchies for operating units if you have complex requirements for reporting profit and loss.</source>
        </trans-unit>
        <trans-unit id="262" translate="yes" xml:space="preserve">
