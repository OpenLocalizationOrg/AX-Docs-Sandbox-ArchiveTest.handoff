The arrival overview profile is a collection of rules that will be applied when the Arrival overview page is opened by a user. You can use this procedure in demo data company USMF. This procedure would typically be carried out by a receiving clerk.\n\n\n\n\n\n1. Go to Inventory management > Setup > Distribution > Arrival overview profiles.\n2. Click New.\n    * Because you will almost always work in the same warehouse offloading full truck loads, you should create an arrival overview profile to simplify the process of registering received items.  \n3. In the Arrival overview profile name field, type a value.\n4. In the Show lines field, select an option.\n    * Select which lines to show for the receipts:   All – Show all lines, regardless of status.   In progress – Show lines for receipts in which the progress is Complete or Partly. This means that for each line, either the full quantity or part of the quantity has been registered in an arrival journal.   Not complete – Show lines for receipts in which the progress is None or Partly. This means that for each line, nothing or only part of the quantity has been registered in an arrival journal.  \n5. Expand or collapse the Arrival options section.\n6. In the Days forward field, type a value.\n    * This sets a filter to show the receipt lines expected to be received within the next few days (depending on the number you set).  \n7. In the Days back field, type a value.\n    * This sets a filter to show the receipt lines expected to be received a number of days before today.  \n8. In the Warehouses field, type a value.\n    * Filter on one or more warehouses.  \n9. In the Mode of delivery field, select a value.\n    * This sets a filter to show only the receipt lines with this Mode of delivery.  \n10. In the Name field, select WHS.\n11. In the Warehouse field, select warehouse 24.\n    * This is the default warehouse that will be used for registered receipt lines that use this profile.  \n12. In the Location field, select Baydoor.\n    * This is the default location that will be used for registered receipt lines that use this profile.  \n13. Expand or collapse the Arrival query details section.\n14. In the Restrict to site field, select site 2.\n    * This sets a filter to show only the receipt lines with this site.  \n15.
