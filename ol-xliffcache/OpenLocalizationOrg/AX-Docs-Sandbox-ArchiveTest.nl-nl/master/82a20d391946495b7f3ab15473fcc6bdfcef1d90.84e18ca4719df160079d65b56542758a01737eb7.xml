The mandate that the customer signs authorizes the creditor to collect a payment and instructs the customer's bank to pay the collection. This topic is organized to show the process for setting up SEPA direct debit mandates.\n\n## Prerequisites\nThe following table shows the prerequisites that must be in place before you start.\n\n| Category       | Prerequisite                                                                                                                                              |\n|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Country/region | The primary address for the legal entity must be in the following countries/regions: Austria, Belgium, Germany, Spain, France, Italy, or the Netherlands. |\n\n1. Set up a number sequence for direct debit mandates\nEach direct debit mandate must have a unique number. Use the **Number sequences** page to create a number sequence for direct debit mandates. You will use this identifier to assign the number sequence to the direct debit mandate system on the **Accounts receivable parameters** page.\n\n2. Set up Accounts receivable parameters for direct debit mandates\nUse the **Accounts receivable parameters** page to set up parameters for direct debit mandates. To set up the parameters, on the **Direct debit** tab, change the default parameters as you require. Then, on the **Number sequences** tab, update the **Direct debit mandate ID** field with the number sequence that you set up earlier.\n\n3. Set up a method of payment for direct debit mandates\nYou must set up a method of payment for direct debit mandates. You use this method of payment to query for invoices to generate direct debit payments for. Use the **Methods of payment** page to set up the method of payment. To set up a method of payment for direct debit mandates, you must follow these additional steps for a method of payment:\n\n-   In the **Payment type** field, select **Electronic payment**.\n-   Optional: If you expect each of your customers to have multiple mandates, in the **Period** field, select **Invoice**. A separate payment will be created for each invoice, and each payment will use the mandate that is specified for the invoice.\n-   Select the **Require mandate** option to create payments by using direct debit mandates. The **Require mandate** option is available only if you select **Electronic payment** in the **Payment type** field.\n\nSee Also\n[Direct debit overview](sepa-direct-debit-overview.md)
