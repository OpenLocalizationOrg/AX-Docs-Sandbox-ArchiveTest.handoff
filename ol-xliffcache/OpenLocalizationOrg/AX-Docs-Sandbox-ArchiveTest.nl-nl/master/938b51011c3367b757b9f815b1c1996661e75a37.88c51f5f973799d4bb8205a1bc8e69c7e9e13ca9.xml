This workspace helps you gain insights into reserved and available inventory anytime and anywhere.\n\nThis mobile workspace is intended to be used with the Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Unified Operations mobile app.\n\n## Overview\nTypically, companies have multiple shipments and multiple receipts of inventory every day. These movements constantly change the on-hand inventory status. The **Inventory on-hand** mobile workspace lets you see the cross-company on-hand inventory status, so that you can gain the latest insights into inventory data on the mobile device of your choice. Regardless of whether you work in the warehouse, purchasing, sales, manufacturing, or management, or have other roles, you can access on-hand inventory data anytime and anywhere. \n\nThe mobile workspace provides an instant view of the on-hand status across facilities. It lets you view on-hand inventory across facilities, current material reservations, and unreserved on-hand inventory. You can also enter item numbers to query on-hand inventory, and can do a filtered search for on-hand products or variants. \n\nSpecifically, the mobile workspace provides these features:\n\n-   You can search by product number or product name to find products to view the on-hand inventory status for.\n-   For the selected products, you can view the following information:\n\n    -   On-hand inventory per site\n    -   On-hand inventory per warehouse\n    -   On-hand inventory per location\n    -   On-hand inventory per batch (for batch-controlled products)\n    -   On-hand inventory per inventory status\n    \n-   Product on-hand inventory is shown in the following ways:\n\n    -   By physical inventory (This view represents the total amount.)\n    -   By physical reserved (This view represents the reserved amount.)\n    -   By available physical (This view represents available amount that has no reservations.)\n\n## Prerequisites\nThe prerequisites differ, based on the version of Microsoft Dynamics 365 that has been deployed for your organization.\n\n### Prerequisites if you use Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, Enterprise edition July 2017 update \nIf Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, Enterprise edition July 2017 update has been deployed for your organization, the system administrator must publish the **Inventory on-hand** mobile workspace. For instructions, see [Publish a mobile workspace](/dynamics365/unified-operations/dev-itpro/mobile-apps/publish-mobile-workspace).\n\n### Prerequisites if you use Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Operations version 1611 with platform update 3 or later\nIf Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Operations version 1611 with platform update 3 or later has been deployed for your organization, the system administrator must complete the following prerequisites. \n\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"header\">\n<th>Prerequisite</th>\n<th>Role</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td>Implement KB 4013633.</td>\n<td>System administrator</td>\n\n<td>KB 4013633 is an X++ update or metadata hotfix that contains the <strong>Inventory on-hand</strong> mobile workspace.

Start the app on your mobile device.\n2.  Enter your Dynamics 365 URL.\n3.  The first time that you sign in, you're prompted for your user name and password. Enter your credentials.\n4.  After you sign in, the available workspaces for your company are shown. Note that if your system administrator publishes a new workspace later, you will have to refresh the list of mobile workspaces.\n\n    [![Pull to refresh](./media/pull-to-refresh-list-of-workspaces-183x300.png)](./media/pull-to-refresh-list-of-workspaces.png)\n\n## View the on-hand inventory for a product by using the Inventory on-hand mobile workspace\n\n1.  On your mobile device, select the **Inventory on-hand** workspace.\n\n2.  Select **Check on-hand for an item**. You see a list of the products that are loaded into your app for offline use. By default, 50 items are loaded, but a developer can change this number. For more information, developers should see [Mobile platform](/dynamics365/unified-operations/dev-itpro/mobile-apps/mobile-platform).\n3.  If your item isn't in the list, select **Search more**. Search by product number, or switch to a search by product name.\n\n4.  Select a product. If the item has an image, the image is shown.\n5.  Select one of the following options to view the status of on-hand inventory:\n\n    -   View on-hand per site\n    -   View on-hand per warehouse\n    -   View on-hand per location\n    -   View on-hand per batch (for batch-controlled products)\n    -   View on-hand per inventory status\n\n    Product on-hand inventory is shown in the following ways:\n    -   By physical inventory (This view represents the total amount.)\n    -   By physical reserved (This view represents the reserved amount.)\n    -   By available physical (This view represents the available amount that has no reservations.)\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,793],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"# required metadata\n\ntitle: Inventory on-hand mobile workspace\ndescription: This topic provides information about the Inventory on-hand mobile workspace.
