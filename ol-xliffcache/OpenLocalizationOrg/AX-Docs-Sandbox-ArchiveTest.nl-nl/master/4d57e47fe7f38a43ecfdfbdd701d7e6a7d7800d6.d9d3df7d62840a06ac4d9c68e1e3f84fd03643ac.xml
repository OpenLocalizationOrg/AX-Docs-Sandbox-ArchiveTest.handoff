Follow these steps to select the type of workflow to create and open the workflow editor.\n\n1.  Open the module that you want to create a new workflow for. For example, to create a workflow for purchase requisitions, click **Procurement and sourcing**.\n2.  Click **Setup** &gt; **\\[Module name\\] workflows**.\n3.  On the list page that appears, on the Action Pane, click **New**.\n4.  On the **Create workflow** page, select the type of workflow to create, and then click **Create workflow**. The workflow editor appears. You can now use the following procedures to design the workflow.\n\n## Drag workflow elements onto the canvas\nThe **Workflow elements** area of the workflow editor contains the elements that you can add to your workflow. To add elements to the workflow, drag them onto the canvas.\n\n## Connect the elements\nTo connect one workflow element to another, hold the pointer over an element until connection points appear. Click a connection point, and drag it to another element. Be sure to connect all the elements.\n\n## Configure the properties of the workflow\nFollow these steps to configure the properties of the workflow.\n\n1.  Click the canvas to make sure that no workflow element is selected.\n2.  Click **Properties** to open the **Properties** page for the workflow.\n3.  Follow the procedures in the [Configure the properties of a workflow](configure-workflow-properties.md) topic.\n\n## Configure the elements of the workflow\nConfigure each element that you dragged onto the canvas. For information about how to configure each workflow element, see the following topics:\n\n-   [Configure a manual task](configure-manual-task-workflow.md)\n-   [Configure an automated task](configure-automated-task-workflow.md)\n-   [Configure an approval process](configure-approval-process-workflow.md)\n-   [Configure an approval step](configure-approval-step-workflow.md)\n-   [Configure a manual decision](configure-manual-decision-workflow.md)\n-   [Configure a conditional decision](configure-conditional-decision-workflow.md)\n-   [Configure a parallel activity](configure-parallel-activity-workflow.md)\n-   [Configure a parallel branch](configure-parallel-branch-workflow.md)\n-   [Configure a line-item workflow](configure-line-item-workflow.md)\n\n## Resolve any errors or warnings\nThe **Errors and warnings** pane at the bottom of the workflow editor shows messages that have been generated for the workflow. To find the element where an error or warning occurred, double-click the error or warning message. You must resolve all errors and warnings before you can make the workflow active.\n\n## Save and activate the workflow\nWhen you're ready to save and activate the workflow, follow these steps.\n\n1.  Click **Save and close** to close the workflow editor and open the **Save workflow** page.\n2.  Enter comments about the changes that you've made to the workflow, and then click **OK**.\n3.  If all errors and warnings have been resolved, the **Activate workflow** page appears. Select one of the following options:\n    -   To activate this version of the workflow, click **Activate the new version**. When a workflow is active, users can submit documents to it for processing.\n    -   If you don't want to activate this version, click **Do not activate the new version**. You can activate the workflow later.\n\n\n\n\n\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,634],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"# required metadata\n\ntitle: Create a workflow\ndescription: This topics
