You can walk through this procedure using demo data, or using your own data.\n\n1. Go to Released product maintenance.\n2. Click Units.\n\n## Create a unit of measure\n1. Click New.\n2. In the Unit field, type a value.\n    * Enter the ID or symbol to use when referring to the unit of measure.  \n3. In the Description field, type a value.\n    * Enter a descriptive name for the unit of measure in the system language.  \n4. In the Unit class field, select an option.\n    * The unit class defines what logical grouping, such as area, mass, or quantity, the unit of measure is part of.  \n5. In the Decimal precision field, enter a number.\n    * Specify the number of decimals that the converted unit of measure must be rounded to when a calculation is completed for the unit of measure.  \n6. Click Save.\n\n## Define unit translations\n1. Click Unit texts.\n2. Click New.\n    * Use unit text to create a translation of the ID or a symbol representing the unit of measure for use on external documents in customer- or vendor-specific languages.  \n3. In the Language field, enter or select a value.\n4. In the Text field, type a value.\n5. Click Save.\n6. Close the page.\n7. Click Translated unit descriptions.\n8. Click New.\n    * Define language-specific descriptions for the unit of measure.  \n9. In the Language field, enter or select a value.\n10. In the Description field, type a value.\n11. Click Save.\n12. Close the page.\n\n## Define unit conversion rules\n1. Click Unit conversions.\n    * Define rules for converting the unit of measure to and from other units of measure in the selected unit class.  \n2. Click New to open the drop dialog.\n3. In the Factor field, enter a number.\n    * Conversion factor between the From unit and the To unit. For example, the conversion factor from centimeter to meter is 100 because there are 100 centimeters in one meter.  \n4. In the To unit field, enter or select a value.\n5. In the Rounding field, select an option.\n    * Define how the converted value should be rounded.  \n6. Click OK.\n7.
