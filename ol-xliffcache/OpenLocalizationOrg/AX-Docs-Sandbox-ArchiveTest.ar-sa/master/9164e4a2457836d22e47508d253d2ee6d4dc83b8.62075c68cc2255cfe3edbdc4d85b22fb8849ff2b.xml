You can create a coverage group that contains settings for all products that are linked to the coverage group. Click **Master planning &gt; Setup &gt; Coverage &gt; Coverage groups** to create a coverage group. You can link a coverage group to a product. If the link is specific to a site, warehouse, or product dimension, use the **Coverage group** field on the **Item coverage** page. If the link is generic, regardless of the product dimensions, use the **Coverage group** on the **Plan** FastTab on the **Product details** page. If you do not link a coverage group to a product, master planning uses the **General coverage group** that is specified on the **Master planning parameters** page as the default.\n\n-   Specify coverage settings for a product. You can create coverage settings for a specific product. Click **Product information management &gt; Products &gt; Released products**. Select the product, on the **Action Pane**, on the **Plan** tab, in the **Coverage group**, click **Item coverage** to open the **Item coverage** page. If the product is already linked to a coverage group, you can override the coverage group settings by using the **Override** field. The coverage settings on the **Item coverage** page take precedence over the settings on the **Coverage group** page.\n\n<!-- -->\n\n-   Specify coverage settings for a product by using a wizard. The wizard is a step-by-step guide to help you set up the primary item coverage parameters. On the **Item coverage** page, click **Wizard** to open the **Item Coverage Wizard**.\n\n<!-- -->\n\n-   Specify coverage settings for a dimension group. Click **Product information management &gt; Common &gt; Released products**. On the **Released product detail **page, on the **General** tab, in the **Administration** group, click the **Storage dimension group** link. On the **Storage dimension group** page, select the **Coverage plan by dimension** field to create the coverage settings for a dimension in the storage dimension group. All product dimensions, such as configuration, color, size, style, must have the **Coverage plan by dimension** field selected.\n\n\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n[Master plans](master-plans.md)\n\n\n\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,715],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"# required metadata\n\ntitle: Coverage settings\ndescription: Master scheduling uses coverage settings to calculate item requirements. \nauthor: YuyuScheller\nmanager: AnnBe\nms.date: 06/20/2017\nms.topic: article\nms.prod: \nms.service: dynamics-ax-applications\nms.technology: \n\n# optional metadata\n\nms.search.form: ReqGroup, ReqItemTable, ReqItemTableWizard\n# ROBOTS: \naudience: Application User\n# ms.devlang: \nms.reviewer: yuyus\nms.search.scope: Core, AX 7.0.0, Operations, UnifiedOperations\n# ms.tgt_pltfrm: \nms.custom: 2494\nms.assetid: 5a95ae4f-ca75-47d9-a1c3-68c97b42f166\nms.search.region: Global\nms.search.industry: Manufacturing\nms.author: roxanad\nms.search.validFrom: 2016-02-28\nms.dyn365.ops.version: AX 7.0.0\n","nodes":[{"content":"Coverage settings","nodes":[{"pos":[0,17],"content":"Coverage settings","nodes":[{"content":"Coverage settings","pos":[0,17]}]}],"path":["title"],"extradata":"MT"},{"content":"Master scheduling uses coverage settings to calculate item requirements.","nodes":[{"pos":[0,72],"content":"Master scheduling uses coverage settings to calculate item requirements.","nodes":[{"content":"Master scheduling uses coverage settings to calculate item requirements.","pos":[0,72]}]}],"path":["description"],"extradata":"MT"}],"header":"# required metadata\n","yml":true},{"pos":[723,740],"content":"Coverage settings","linkify":"Coverage settings","nodes":[{"content":"Coverage settings","pos":[0,17]}]},{"content":"Master scheduling uses coverage settings to calculate item requirements.","pos":[786,858]},{"content":"You can specify coverage settings in several ways:","pos":[861,911]},{"content":"Specify coverage settings for a coverage group.","pos":[917,964]},{"content":"You can create a coverage group that contains settings for all products that are linked to the coverage group.","pos":[965,1075]},{"content":"Click <bpt id=\"p1\">**</bpt>Master planning <ph id=\"ph1\">&amp;gt;</ph> Setup <ph id=\"ph2\">&amp;gt;</ph> Coverage <ph id=\"ph3\">&amp;gt;</ph> Coverage groups<ept id=\"p1\">**</ept> to create a coverage group.","pos":[1076,1175],"source":" Click **Master planning &gt;
