The demo data company used to create this task is USMF. This task is intended for the process engineer or the value stream manager, as they prepare production of a new or modified product in a lean environment.\n\n\n## Create a new kanban rule\n1. Go to Product information management > Lean manufacturing > Kanban rules.\n2. Click New.\n3. In the Replenishment strategy field, select 'Scheduled'.\n4. In the First plan activity field, enter or select a value.\n    * Select SpeakerAssemblyAndPolish.  \n5. Select the Multiple activities check box.\n    * The purpose is to include more than one activity in the kanban rule. You choose a path in the production flow when you select the last plan activity.  \n6. In the Last plan activity field, enter or select a value.\n    * Select SpeakerTestAndPackaging. After you select the value, a page automatically opens. Select the kanban flow SpeakerAssemblyAndPolish > SpeakerTestAndPackaging. Click OK.  \n7. Expand the Details section.\n8. In the Product field, enter or select a value.\n    * Select Item L0006.  \n\n## Create kanban and view jobs\n1. Expand the Kanbans section.\n2. Click Add.\n3. In the Number of new kanbans field, enter '1'.\n    * This will create one kanban.  \n4. Set Product quantity to '3'.\n    * Kanban will process 3 products.  \n5. In the Due date/time field, enter a date and time.\n    * You can enter Today.  \n6. Click Create.\n7. Click Details.\n    * Notice that the kanban has two process jobs from the production flow. The first one is SpeakerAssemblyAndPolish, and the second one is SpeakerTestAndPackaging.  \n    * This is the last step!  \n\n","nodes":[{"pos":[5,671],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"# required metadata \n \ntitle: Create a kanban rule for multiple activities\ndescription: This procedure shows how to create a kanban rule that includes multiple activities from a production flow. \nauthor: ChristianRytt\nmanager: AnnBe \nms.date: 08/24/2016\nms.topic: business-process \nms.prod:  \nms.service: dynamics-ax-applications \nms.technology:  \n \n# optional metadata \n \n# ms.search.form:   \naudience: Application User \n# ms.devlang:  \nms.reviewer: yuyus\nms.search.scope: Operations \n# ms.tgt_pltfrm:  \n# ms.custom:  \nms.search.region: Global\nms.search.industry: Manufacturing\nms.author: crytt\nms.search.validFrom: 2016-06-30 \nms.dyn365.ops.version: Version 7.0.0 ","nodes":[{"content":"Create a kanban rule for multiple activities","nodes":[{"pos":[0,44],"content":"Create a kanban rule for multiple activities","nodes":[{"content":"Create a kanban rule for multiple activities","pos":[0,44]}]}],"path":["title"],"extradata":"MT"},{"content":"This procedure shows how to create a kanban rule that includes multiple activities from a production flow.","nodes":[{"pos":[0,106],"content":"This procedure shows how to create a kanban rule that includes multiple activities from a production flow.","nodes":[{"content":"This procedure shows how to create a kanban rule that includes multiple activities from a production flow.","pos":[0,106]}]}],"path":["description"],"extradata":"MT"}],"header":"# required metadata \n","yml":true},{"pos":[678,722],"content":"Create a kanban rule for multiple activities","linkify":"Create a kanban rule for multiple activities","nodes":[{"content":"Create a kanban rule for multiple activities","pos":[0,44]}]},{"content":"This procedure shows how to create a kanban rule that includes multiple activities from a production flow.","pos":[792,898]},{"content":"The demo data company used to create this task is USMF.","pos":[899,954]},{"content":"This task is intended for the process engineer or the value stream manager, as they prepare production of a new or modified product in a lean environment.","pos":[955,1109]},{"pos":[1115,1139],"content":"Create a new kanban rule","linkify":"Create a new kanban rule","nodes":[{"content":"Create a new kanban rule","pos":[0,24]}]},{"content":"Go to Product information management &gt; Lean manufacturing &gt; Kanban rules.","pos":[1143,1216],"source":"Go to Product information management > Lean manufacturing > Kanban rules."},{"content":"Click New.","pos":[1220,1230]},{"content":"In the Replenishment strategy field, select 'Scheduled'.","pos":[1234,1290]},{"content":"In the First plan activity field, enter or select a value.","pos":[1294,1352]},{"content":"Select SpeakerAssemblyAndPolish.","pos":[1359,1391]},{"content":"Select the Multiple activities check box.","pos":[1397,1438]},{"content":"The purpose is to include more than one activity in the kanban rule.","pos":[1445,1513]},{"content":"You choose a path in the production flow when you select the last plan activity.","pos":[1514,1594]},{"content":"In the Last plan activity field, enter or select a value.","pos":[1600,1657]},{"content":"Select SpeakerTestAndPackaging.","pos":[1664,1695]},{"content":"After you select the value, a page automatically opens.","pos":[1696,1751]},{"content":"Select the kanban flow SpeakerAssemblyAndPolish &gt; SpeakerTestAndPackaging.","pos":[1752,1826],"source":" Select the kanban flow SpeakerAssemblyAndPolish > SpeakerTestAndPackaging."},{"content":"Click OK.","pos":[1827,1836]},{"content":"Expand the Details section.","pos":[1842,1869]},{"content":"In the Product field, enter or select a value.","pos":[1873,1919]},{"content":"Select Item L0006.","pos":[1926,1944]},{"pos":[1951,1978],"content":"Create kanban and view jobs","linkify":"Create kanban and view jobs","nodes":[{"content":"Create kanban and view jobs","pos":[0,27]}]},{"content":"Expand the Kanbans section.","pos":[1982,2009]},{"content":"Click Add.","pos":[2013,2023]},{"content":"In the Number of new kanbans field, enter '1'.","pos":[2027,2073]},{"content":"This will create one kanban.","pos":[2080,2108]},{"content":"Set Product quantity to '3'.","pos":[2114,2142]},{"content":"Kanban will process 3 products.","pos":[2149,2180]},{"content":"In the Due date/time field, enter a date and time.","pos":[2186,2236]},{"content":"You can enter Today.","pos":[2243,2263]},{"content":"Click Create.","pos":[2269,2282]},{"content":"Click Details.","pos":[2286,2300]},{"content":"Notice that the kanban has two process jobs from the production flow.","pos":[2307,2376]},{"content":"The first one is SpeakerAssemblyAndPolish, and the second one is SpeakerTestAndPackaging.","pos":[2377,2466]},{"content":"This is the last step!","pos":[2475,2497]}]}
