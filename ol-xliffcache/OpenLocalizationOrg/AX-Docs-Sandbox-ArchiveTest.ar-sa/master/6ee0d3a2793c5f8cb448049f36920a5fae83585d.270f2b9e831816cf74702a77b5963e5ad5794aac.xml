A scoring method is a set of criteria that can be used to compare bids that are sent in reply to a request for quotation (RFQ). For example, you might want to rate a vendor on past performance, or rate whether the company is environmentally friendly or a good collaborator, or you might want to compare bids based on price. The scoring method can be associated with a solicitation type as the default scoring method for RFQs of that type. These tasks would typically be carried out by a purchasing manager. You can use this procedure in demo data company USMF or on your own data.\n\n1. Go to Procurement and sourcing > Setup > Request for quotation > Scoring method.\n2. Click New.\n3.
