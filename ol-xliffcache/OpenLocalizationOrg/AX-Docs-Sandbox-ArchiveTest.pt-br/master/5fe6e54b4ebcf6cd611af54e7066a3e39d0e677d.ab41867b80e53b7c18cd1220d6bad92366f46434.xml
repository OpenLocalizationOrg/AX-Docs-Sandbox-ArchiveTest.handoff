A master data or transaction record that requires an identifier is referred to as a reference. Before you can create new records for a reference, you must set up a number sequence and associate it with the reference. This procedure explains how to set up all required number sequences at the same time by using a wizard. The demo data company used to create this procedure is USMF.\n\n1. Go to Organization administration > Number sequences > Number sequences.\n2. Click Generate.\n3. Click Next.\n    * On this page, you can modify the identification code, the lowest value, and the highest value. In addition, you can indicate whether the number sequence must be continuous.   \n    * Do not select the Continuous option if you must preallocate numbers for the number sequence.     To add a scope segment to the format of a number sequence, select the format in the list, and then click Include scope in format.     To remove a scope segment from the format of a number sequence, select the format in the list, and then click Remove scope from format.     To exclude a number sequence from automatic generation, select the number sequence in the list, and then click Delete.  \n4. Click Next.\n5.
