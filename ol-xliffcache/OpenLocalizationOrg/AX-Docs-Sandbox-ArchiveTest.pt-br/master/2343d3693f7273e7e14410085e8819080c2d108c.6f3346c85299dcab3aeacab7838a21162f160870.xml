On the **Invoice** page, select **Cancel**, and then select **Correct invoice**. Select a reason code, add comments, and select the date for new corrected invoice. You can modify the corrected invoice, and post it. \n\nWhen you post the corrected invoice, a canceling invoice is created for a credit amount that equals the original invoice amount. Therefore, the combined balance of the original invoice and the canceling invoice is 0 (zero). The canceling invoice is settled against the original invoice. \n\nAfter you post the corrected invoice, you will have three invoices:\n\n-   **Original invoice** – The invoice that includes the information that you're correcting.\n-   **Canceling invoice** – The system-generated credit invoice that was created to cancel the invoice that was most recently corrected.\n-   **Corrected invoice** – The invoice that contains the corrected invoice information.\n\nYou can identify canceling and correcting invoices in two ways:\n\n-   The **All free text invoices** page includes a **Correction** column, where you can see which invoices are canceling invoices and corrected invoices.\n-   The header of the free text invoice shows a status of **Cancelling invoice '\\[invoice number\\]'** or **Corrected invoice '\\[invoice number\\]'**.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> This feature is available only if the **Free text invoice correction** configuration key is selected.\n\n\n\n","nodes":[{"pos":[4,731],"embed":true,"restype":"x-metadata","content":"# required metadata\n\ntitle: Correct a free text invoice\ndescription: This article explains how to correct a
